26926,"We ended the war in Iraq, refocused our attention on those who actually killed us on 9/11.","Barack Obama","President","DEMOCRAT","2012-10-22.txt",17,66,-0.628749,0
26927,"And as a consequence, Al Qaeda's core leadership has been decimated.","Barack Obama","President","DEMOCRAT","2012-10-22.txt",11,67,-0.679828,1
26928,"In addition, we're now able to transition out of Afghanistan in a responsible way, making sure that Afghans take responsibility for their own security.","Barack Obama","President","DEMOCRAT","2012-10-22.txt",24,68,0,-1
26929,"And that allows us also to rebuild alliances and make friends around the world to combat future threats.","Barack Obama","President","DEMOCRAT","2012-10-22.txt",18,69,-0.358599,-1
26930,"Now with respect to Libya, as I indicated in the last debate, when we received that phone call, I immediately made sure that, number one, that we did everything we could to secure those Americans who were still in harm's way; number two, that we would investigate exactly what happened, and number three, most importantly, that we would go after those who killed Americans and we would bring them to justice.","Barack Obama","President","DEMOCRAT","2012-10-22.txt",71,70,0.54404,1
26931,"And that's exactly what we're going to do.","Barack Obama","President","DEMOCRAT","2012-10-22.txt",8,71,0.617075,-1
26932,"But I think it's important to step back and think about what happened in Libya.","Barack Obama","President","DEMOCRAT","2012-10-22.txt",15,72,0,-1
26933,"Keep in mind that I and Americans took leadership in organizing an international coalition that made sure that we were able to, without putting troops on the ground at the cost of less than what we spent in two weeks in Iraq, liberate a country that had been under the yoke of dictatorship for 40 years.","Barack Obama","President","DEMOCRAT","2012-10-22.txt",56,73,-0.247087,1

26936,"Now that represents the opportunity we have to take advantage of.","Barack Obama","President","DEMOCRAT","2012-10-22.txt",11,76,0.733764,-1
26937,"And, you know, Governor Romney, I'm glad that you agree that we have been successful in going after Al Qaida, but I have to tell you that, you know, your strategy previously has been one that has been all over the map and is not designed to keep Americans safe or to build on the opportunities that exist in the Middle East.","Barack Obama","President","DEMOCRAT","2012-10-22.txt",62,77,0.552122,-1
26938,"Well, my strategy is pretty straightforward, which is to go after the bad guys, to make sure we do our very best to interrupt them, to -- to kill them, to take them out of the picture.","Mitt Romney","Governor","REPUBLICAN","2012-10-22.txt",37,78,-0.481267,-1
26939,"But my strategy is broader than that.","Mitt Romney","Governor","REPUBLICAN","2012-10-22.txt",7,79,0.712825,-1
26940,"That's -- that's important, of course.","Mitt Romney","Governor","REPUBLICAN","2012-10-22.txt",6,80,0.684893,-1
26941,"But the key that we're going to have to pursue is a -- is a pathway to get the Muslim world to be able to reject extremism on its own.","Mitt Romney","Governor","REPUBLICAN","2012-10-22.txt",30,81,-0.392107,-1
26942,"We don't want another Iraq, we don't want another Afghanistan.","Mitt Romney","Governor","REPUBLICAN","2012-10-22.txt",10,82,-0.207114,-1
26943,"That's not the right course for us.","Mitt Romney","Governor","REPUBLICAN","2012-10-22.txt",7,83,-0.482074,-1
26944,"The right course for us is to make sure that we go after the -- the people who are leaders of these various anti-American groups and these -- these jihadists, but also help the Muslim world.","Mitt Romney","Governor","REPUBLICAN","2012-10-22.txt",36,84,0,-1
26945,"And how do we do that?","Mitt Romney","Governor","REPUBLICAN","2012-10-22.txt",6,85,0.203916,-1
26946,"A group of Arab scholars came together, organized by the U.N., to look at how we can help the -- the world reject these -- these terrorists.","Mitt Romney","Governor","REPUBLICAN","2012-10-22.txt",27,86,-0.659654,0
26947,"And the answer they came up with was this:","Mitt Romney","Governor","REPUBLICAN","2012-10-22.txt",9,87,0,-1
26949,"We should key our foreign aid, our direct foreign investment, and that of our friends, we should coordinate it to make sure that we -- we push back and give them more economic development.","Mitt Romney","Governor","REPUBLICAN","2012-10-22.txt",34,89,0.775551,-1

26953,"We have to help these nations create civil societies.","Mitt Romney","Governor","REPUBLICAN","2012-10-22.txt",9,93,0,-1
26954,"But what's been happening over the last couple of years is, as we've watched this tumult in the Middle East, this rising tide of chaos occur, you see Al Qaida rushing in, you see other jihadist groups rushing in.","Mitt Romney","Governor","REPUBLICAN","2012-10-22.txt",39,94,-0.643143,1
26955,"And -- and they're throughout many nations in the Middle East.","Mitt Romney","Governor","REPUBLICAN","2012-10-22.txt",11,95,0,0
26956,"It's wonderful that Libya seems to be making some progress, despite this terrible tragedy.","Mitt Romney","Governor","REPUBLICAN","2012-10-22.txt",14,96,0.376607,-1
26957,"But next door, of course, we have Egypt.","Mitt Romney","Governor","REPUBLICAN","2012-10-22.txt",8,97,0,0
26958,"Libya's 6 million population; Egypt, 80 million population.","Mitt Romney","Governor","REPUBLICAN","2012-10-22.txt",8,98,0,1
26959,"We want -- we want to make sure that we're seeing progress throughout the Middle East.","Mitt Romney","Governor","REPUBLICAN","2012-10-22.txt",16,99,0.716202,-1
26960,"With Mali now having North Mali taken over by Al Qaida; with Syria having Assad continuing to -- to kill, to murder his own people, this is a region in tumult.","Mitt Romney","Governor","REPUBLICAN","2012-10-22.txt",31,100,-0.735286,1
26961,"And, of course, Iran on the path to a nuclear weapon, we've got real (inaudible).","Mitt Romney","Governor","REPUBLICAN","2012-10-22.txt",15,101,-0.443682,1
26963,"Governor Romney, I'm glad that you recognize that Al Qaida is a threat, because a few months ago when you were asked what's the biggest geopolitical threat facing America, you said Russia, not Al Qaida; you said Russia, in the 1980s, they're now calling to ask for their foreign policy back because, you know, the Cold War's been over for 20 years.","Barack Obama","President","DEMOCRAT","2012-10-22.txt",62,103,-0.439301,1
26964,"But Governor, when it comes to our foreign policy, you seem to want to import the foreign policies of the 1980s, just like the social policies of the 1950s and the economic policies of the 1920s.","Barack Obama","President","DEMOCRAT","2012-10-22.txt",36,104,0,0
26965,"You say that you're not interested in duplicating what happened in Iraq.","Barack Obama","President","DEMOCRAT","2012-10-22.txt",12,105,-0.453807,-1
26966,"But just a few weeks ago, you said you think we should have more troops in Iraq right now.","Barack Obama","President","DEMOCRAT","2012-10-22.txt",19,106,0,1
26967,"And the -- the challenge we have -- I know you haven't been in a position to actually execute foreign policy -- but every time you've offered an opinion, you've been wrong.","Barack Obama","President","DEMOCRAT","2012-10-22.txt",32,107,0,-1
26968,"You said we should have gone into Iraq, despite that fact that there were no weapons of mass destruction.","Barack Obama","President","DEMOCRAT","2012-10-22.txt",19,108,-0.512675,1
26969,"You said that we should still have troops in Iraq to this day.","Barack Obama","President","DEMOCRAT","2012-10-22.txt",13,109,-0.395844,1
26970,"You indicated that we shouldn't be passing nuclear treaties with Russia despite the fact that 71 senators, Democrats and Republicans, voted for it.","Barack Obama","President","DEMOCRAT","2012-10-22.txt",23,110,-0.414058,1
26971,"You said that, first, we should not have a timeline in Afghanistan.","Barack Obama","President","DEMOCRAT","2012-10-22.txt",12,111,0,1
26972,"Then you said we should.","Barack Obama","President","DEMOCRAT","2012-10-22.txt",5,112,0,0
26973,"Now you say maybe or it depends, which means not only were you wrong, but you were also confusing in sending mixed messages both to our troops and our allies.","Barack Obama","President","DEMOCRAT","2012-10-22.txt",30,113,-0.66517,-1
26974,"So, what -- what we need to do with respect to the Middle East is strong, steady leadership, not wrong and reckless leadership that is all over the map.","Barack Obama","President","DEMOCRAT","2012-10-22.txt",29,114,0.664983,-1
26975,"And unfortunately, that's the kind of opinions that you've offered throughout this campaign, and it is not a recipe for American strength, or keeping America safe over the long haul.","Barack Obama","President","DEMOCRAT","2012-10-22.txt",30,115,0,-1
26977,"Well, of course I don't concur with what the president said about my own record and the things that I've said.","Mitt Romney","Governor","REPUBLICAN","2012-10-22.txt",21,117,0.431854,-1
26978,"They don't happen to be accurate.","Mitt Romney","Governor","REPUBLICAN","2012-10-22.txt",6,118,0,-1
26979,"But -- but I can say this, that we're talking about the Middle East and how to help the Middle East reject the kind of terrorism we're seeing, and the rising tide of tumult and -- and confusion.","Mitt Romney","Governor","REPUBLICAN","2012-10-22.txt",38,119,-0.824832,-1
26980,"And -- and attacking me is not an agenda.","Mitt Romney","Governor","REPUBLICAN","2012-10-22.txt",9,120,-0.443214,-1
26981,"Attacking me is not talking about how we're going to deal with the challenges that exist in the Middle East, and take advantage of the opportunity there, and stem the tide of this violence.","Mitt Romney","Governor","REPUBLICAN","2012-10-22.txt",34,121,-0.482887,-1
26983,"First of all, Russia I indicated is a geopolitical foe.","Mitt Romney","Governor","REPUBLICAN","2012-10-22.txt",10,123,-0.250713,1
26987,"It's a geopolitical foe, and I said in the same -- in the same paragraph I said, and Iran is the greatest national security threat we face.","Mitt Romney","Governor","REPUBLICAN","2012-10-22.txt",27,127,-0.746558,1
26988,"Russia does continue to battle us in the U.N. time and time again.","Mitt Romney","Governor","REPUBLICAN","2012-10-22.txt",13,128,-0.355708,1
26989,"I have clear eyes on this.","Mitt Romney","Governor","REPUBLICAN","2012-10-22.txt",6,129,0.243569,-1
26990,"I'm not going to wear rose-colored glasses when it comes to Russia, or Mr. Putin.","Mitt Romney","Governor","REPUBLICAN","2012-10-22.txt",15,130,-0.524603,-1
26991,"And I'm certainly not going to say to him, I'll give you more flexibility after the election.","Mitt Romney","Governor","REPUBLICAN","2012-10-22.txt",17,131,0,-1
26992,"After the election, he'll get more backbone.","Mitt Romney","Governor","REPUBLICAN","2012-10-22.txt",7,132,0,-1
26993,"Number two, with regards to Iraq, you and I agreed I believe that there should be a status of forces agreement.","Mitt Romney","Governor","REPUBLICAN","2012-10-22.txt",21,133,0.443363,0
26996,"You didn't want a status of...","Mitt Romney","Governor","REPUBLICAN","2012-10-22.txt",6,136,-0.305177,-1
26997,"What I would not have had done was left 10,000 troops in Iraq that would tie us down.","Barack Obama","President","DEMOCRAT","2012-10-22.txt",18,137,-0.419047,1
26998,"And that certainly would not help us in the Middle East.","Barack Obama","President","DEMOCRAT","2012-10-22.txt",11,138,-0.432094,-1
26999,"I'm sorry, you actually -- there was a -- there was an effort on the part of the president to have a status of forces agreement, and I concurred in that, and said that we should have some number of troops that stayed on.","Mitt Romney","Governor","REPUBLICAN","2012-10-22.txt",44,139,-0.237889,1
27000,"That was something I concurred with...","Mitt Romney","Governor","REPUBLICAN","2012-10-22.txt",6,140,0,1
27005,"That was my posture as well.","Mitt Romney","Governor","REPUBLICAN","2012-10-22.txt",6,145,0.523483,-1
27006,"You thought it should have been 5,000 troops...","Mitt Romney","Governor","REPUBLICAN","2012-10-22.txt",8,146,-0.262833,1
27010,"I thought there should have been more troops, but you know what?","Mitt Romney","Governor","REPUBLICAN","2012-10-22.txt",12,150,-0.317283,-1
27011,"The answer was we got...","Mitt Romney","Governor","REPUBLICAN","2012-10-22.txt",5,151,0,-1
27013,"... no troops through whatsoever.","Mitt Romney","Governor","REPUBLICAN","2012-10-22.txt",5,153,-0.377696,1
27014,"This was just a few weeks ago that you indicated that we should still have troops in Iraq.","Barack Obama","President","DEMOCRAT","2012-10-22.txt",18,154,-0.284393,1

27035,"You just gave a speech a few weeks ago in which you said we should still have troops in Iraq.","Barack Obama","President","DEMOCRAT","2012-10-22.txt",20,175,-0.367995,1
27036,"That is not a recipe for making sure that we are taking advantage of the opportunities and meeting the challenges of the Middle East.","Barack Obama","President","DEMOCRAT","2012-10-22.txt",24,176,0.267674,-1
27037,"Now, it is absolutely true that we cannot just meet these challenges militarily.","Barack Obama","President","DEMOCRAT","2012-10-22.txt",13,177,0,-1

27041,"Number four, we do have to develop their economic -- their economic capabilities.","Barack Obama","President","DEMOCRAT","2012-10-22.txt",13,181,-0.285328,-1
27042,"But number five, the other thing that we have to do is recognize that we can't continue to do nation building in these regions.","Barack Obama","President","DEMOCRAT","2012-10-22.txt",24,182,-0.373863,-1
27043,"Part of American leadership is making sure that we're doing nation building here at home.","Barack Obama","President","DEMOCRAT","2012-10-22.txt",15,183,0.552033,-1
27044,"That will help us maintain the kind of American leadership that we need.","Barack Obama","President","DEMOCRAT","2012-10-22.txt",13,184,0.645567,-1
27057,"What we've done is organize the international community, saying Assad has to go.","Barack Obama","President","DEMOCRAT","2012-10-22.txt",13,197,0,1
27058,"We've mobilized sanctions against that government.","Barack Obama","President","DEMOCRAT","2012-10-22.txt",6,198,-0.282301,1
27059,"We have made sure that they are isolated.","Barack Obama","President","DEMOCRAT","2012-10-22.txt",8,199,-0.356517,0

27061,"But ultimately, Syrians are going to have to determine their own future.","Barack Obama","President","DEMOCRAT","2012-10-22.txt",12,201,-0.587973,-1
27062,"And so everything we're doing, we're doing in consultation with our partners in the region, including Israel which obviously has a huge interest in seeing what happens in Syria; coordinating with Turkey and other countries in the region that have a great interest in this.","Barack Obama","President","DEMOCRAT","2012-10-22.txt",45,202,0.636295,1
