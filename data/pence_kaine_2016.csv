"0.78"," Mike Pence","The truth of the matter is that what you have in the rise of aggressive Russia, which has had -- increased its influence in Iran, that's now -- now because of this deal is on a pathway in the future to obtain a nuclear -- the leading state sponsor of terror in the world in Iran now has a closer working relationship with Russia because of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama's foreign policy and $150 billion and sanctions all being lifted."
"0.75"," Mike Pence","Well, look, I -- you're running with Hillary Clinton, who wants to raise taxes by $1 trillion, increase spending by $2 trillion, and you say you're going to keep the promises of Social Security."
"0.71"," Mike Pence","And because Hillary Clinton failed to renegotiate a status of forces agreement that would have allowed some American combat troops to remain in Iraq and secure the hard fought gains the American soldier had won by 2009, ISIS was able to be literally conjured up out of the desert, and it's overrun vast areas that the American soldier had won in Operation Iraqi Freedom."
"0.70"," Tim Kaine","And instead of 175,000 American troops deployed overseas, we now have 15,000."
"0.69"," Tim Kaine","She worked across the aisle when she was first lady to get the CHIP program passed so that 8 million low-income kids have health insurance in this country, including 150,000 in Indiana."
"0.69"," Mike Pence","Look, Donald Trump and I have a plan to get this economy moving again just the way that it worked in the 1980s, just the way it worked in the 1960s, and that is by lowering taxes across the board for working families, small businesses and family farms, ending the war on coal that is hurting jobs and hurting this economy even here in Virginia, repealing Obamacare lock, stock, and barrel, and repealing all of the executive orders that Barack Obama has signed that are stifling economic growth in this economy."
"0.68"," Mike Pence","... we delivered $400 million in cash as a ransom payment for Americans held by the radical mullahs in Tehran."
"0.67"," Mike Pence","Less than ten cents on the dollar in the Clinton Foundation has gone to charitable causes."
"0.67"," Tim Kaine","The problem with this, Elaine, is that's exactly what we did 10 years ago and it put the economy into the deepest recession -- the deepest recession since the 1930s."
"0.65"," Mike Pence","We cut taxes, we've made record investments in education and in infrastructure, and I still finish my term with $2 billion in the bank."
"0.65"," Tim Kaine","Less than 10 cents on the dollar of the Clinton Foundation has gone to charitable causes."
"0.65"," Tim Kaine","Donald Trump proposes to deport 16 million people, 11 million who are here without documents."
"0.65"," Mike Pence","I will tell you, after two Syrian refugees were involved in the attack in Paris that is called Paris' 9/11, as governor of the state of Indiana, I have no higher priority than the safety and security of the people of my state."
"0.64"," Mike Pence","And with regard to paying taxes, this whole riff about not paying taxes and people saying he didn't pay taxes for years, Donald Trump has created tens of thousands of jobs."
"0.64"," Mike Pence","And then we found, thanks to the good work of the Associated Press, that more than half her private meetings when she was secretary of state were given to major donors of the Clinton Foundation."
"0.64"," Mike Pence","Weakened America's place in the world after the leadership of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama on the world stage has been followed by an economy that is truly struggling, stifled by an avalanche of more taxes, more regulation, Obamacare, the war on coal, and the kind of trade deals that have put American workers in the back seat."
"0.63"," Tim Kaine","Second thing is we invest in our workforce, from pre-K education to great teachers to debt-free college and tuition-free college for families that make less than $125,000 a year."
"0.63"," Mike Pence","I mean, to be honest with you, if Donald Trump had said all of the things that you've said he said in the way you said he said them, he still wouldn't have a fraction of the insults that Hillary Clinton leveled when she said that half of our supporters were a basket of deplorables."
"0.62"," Tim Kaine","Independent analysts say the Clinton plan would grow the economy by 10.5 million jobs."
"0.62"," Tim Kaine","Do you know that we had 175,000 troops deployed in the battlefield in Iraq and Afghanistan?"
"0.62"," Mike Pence","In the state of Indiana, we've cut unemployment in half; unemployment doubled when he was governor."
"0.62"," Tim Kaine","The State Department did an investigation, and they concluded that everything Hillary Clinton did as secretary of state was completely in the interest of the United States."
"0.62"," Mike Pence","That reset resulted in the invasion of Ukraine, after they'd infiltrated with what are called little green men, Russian soldiers that were dressing up like Ukrainian dissidents, and then they moved all the way into Crimea, took over the Crimean Peninsula."
"0.62"," Mike Pence","While she was secretary of state, the Clinton Foundation accepted tens of millions of dollars from foreign governments and foreign donors."
"0.61"," Mike Pence","Three hundred and five  economists said your plan is bad for the economy."
"0.61"," Mike Pence","The Clinton Foundation accepted foreign contributions from foreign governments and foreign donors while she was secretary of state."
"0.61"," Tim Kaine","Hillary and I also agree that the establishment of humanitarian zones in northern Syria with the provision of international human aid, consistent with the U.N. Security Council resolution that was passed in February 2014, would be a very, very good idea."
"0.60"," Tim Kaine","And, fifth, we have a tax plan that targets tax relief to middle- class individuals and small businesses and asks those at the very top who've benefited as we've come out of recession to pay more."
"0.60"," Tim Kaine","Under Secretary Clinton's leadership, she was part of the national team, public safety team that went after and revived the dormant hunt against bin Laden and wiped him off the face of the Earth."
"0.60"," Mike Pence","It is -- ISIS from Raqqa has overrun vast areas that at great sacrifice the American soldier won in Operation Iraqi Freedom, and yet Senator Kaine still sits here, loyal soldier -- I get all that -- in saying that the foreign policy of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama somehow made the world more secure."
"0.59"," Mike Pence","I mean, when an African-American police officer in Charlotte named Brentley Vinson, an all-star football player who went to Liberty University here in the state, came home, followed his dad into law enforcement, joined the force in Charlotte, joined the force in Charlotte in 2014, was involved in a police action shooting that claimed the life of Keith -- Keith Lamont Scott, it was a tragedy."
"0.59"," Mike Pence","Those tax returns that were -- that came out publicly this week show that he faced some pretty tough times 20 years ago."
"0.59"," Tim Kaine","... border security three years ago, and Governor Pence was against it."
"0.58"," Tim Kaine","There's only 15,000."
"0.58"," Tim Kaine","For the first time ever, we cracked the top 10, 10 safest states, because we worked together."
"0.58"," Mike Pence","He left his state about $2 billion in the hole."
"0.58"," Mike Pence","Elaine, to your point, those judges said it was because there wasn't any evidence yet that -- that ISIS had infiltrated the United States."
"0.58"," Tim Kaine","Ninety percent."
"0.57"," Tim Kaine","On 9/11, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump's hometown was attacked by the worst terrorist attack in the history of the United States."
"0.57"," Mike Pence","But Hillary Clinton actually referred to that moment as an example of implicit bias in the police force, where -- where she used -- when she was asked in the debate a week ago whether there was implicit bias in law enforcement, her only answer was that there's implicit bias in everyone in the United States."
"0.57"," Tim Kaine","The Trump plan would cost 3.5 million jobs."
"0.57"," Tim Kaine","And again, Hillary is running a campaign about stronger together, and Donald Trump -- and this is -- this is not directed at this man, except to the extent that he can't defend Donald Trump -- Donald Trump has run a campaign that's been about one insult after the next."
"0.56"," Tim Kaine","When Hillary Clinton became secretary of state, Governor Pence, did you know that Osama bin Laden was alive?"
"0.56"," Tim Kaine","A $20,000 portrait of Donald Trump?"
"0.56"," Mike Pence","The point is, what this Iran -- so-called Iran deal did was essentially guarantee -- I mean, when I was in Congress, I fought hard on a bipartisan basis with Republican and Democrat members to move forward the toughest sanctions, it -- literally in the history of the United States, against Iran."
"0.56"," Tim Kaine","But he had been stopped by police 40 or 50 times before that fatal incident."
"0.55"," Tim Kaine","But I was governor of a state, and the state law said that there was a death penalty for crimes if the jury determined them to be heinous."
"0.55"," Mike Pence","And the truth of the matter is, the weak and feckless foreign policy of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama has awakened an aggression in Russia that first appeared a few years ago with their move in Georgia, now their move into Crimea, now their move into the wider Middle East."
"0.55"," Tim Kaine","Mike Pence, when he was in Congress, voted against raising the minimum wage above $5.15."
"0.55"," Tim Kaine","The thing I would worry a little bit about is that Donald Trump owes about $650 million to banks, including the Bank of China."
"0.55"," Tim Kaine","As a civil rights lawyer in the South, with the Children's Defense Fund, first lady of Arkansas and this country, senator, secretary of state, it's always been about putting others first."
"0.55"," Mike Pence","I think the fact that -- that under this past administration was of which Hillary Clinton was a part, we've almost doubled the national debt is atrocious."
"0.54"," Mike Pence","I mean, he keeps saying that they prevented -- that Hillary Clinton started the deal with the Iranians prevented Iran from getting a nuclear weapon."
"0.54"," Tim Kaine","And as a candidate, he started his campaign with a speech where he called Mexicans rapists and criminals, and he has pursued the discredited and really outrageous lie that President Obama wasn't born in the United States."
"0.54"," Tim Kaine","Governor Pence made the odd claim, he said inarguably Vladimir Putin is a better leader than President Obama."
"0.54"," Mike Pence","... that it's a good thing, not a bad thing, that it's a good thing -- not a bad thing -- that we're down from 175,000 troops deployed overseas to 15,000."
"0.54"," Mike Pence","And the small and bullying leader of Russia is now dictating terms to the United States to the point where all the United States of America -- the greatest nation on Earth -- just withdraws from talks about a cease-fire while Vladimir Putin puts a missile defense system in Syria while he marshals the forces and begins -- look, we have got to begin to lean into this with strong, broad-shouldered American leadership."
"0.53"," Mike Pence","And I have appreciated the fact that you've supported the Hyde amendment, which bans the use of taxpayer funding for abortion, in the past, but that's not Hillary Clinton's view."
"0.53"," Tim Kaine","And when I came in, we had one of the highest homicide rates in the United States."
"0.53"," Mike Pence","We have the lowest number of troops since the end of the Second World War."
"0.53"," Tim Kaine","We fought very, very hard over the course of my time in local office with our police department, and we reduced our homicide rate nearly in half."
"0.53"," Mike Pence","Our economy is 16 times larger than the Russian economy."
"0.53"," Mike Pence","And a reference to the Iranian deal, the Iranian deal that Hillary Clinton initiated, $150 billion to the radical mullahs in Iran."
"0.53"," Mike Pence","Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine want to continue the policies of open borders, amnesty, catch and release, sanctuary cities, all the things that are driving -- that are driving wages down in this country, Senator, and also too often with criminal aliens in the country, it's bringing heartbreak."
"0.52"," Tim Kaine","It was Hillary Clinton that worked with Russia to get them engaged in a community of nations to stop the Iranian nuclear weapons without firing a shot."
"0.52"," Tim Kaine","The second component of the plan is massive tax breaks for the very top, trillions of dollars of tax breaks for people just like Donald Trump."
"0.52"," Tim Kaine","The New York Times story -- and we need to get this -- but the New York Times suggested that he probably didn't pay taxes for about 18 years starting in 1995."
"0.52"," Mike Pence","We have the smallest Navy since 1916."
"0.52"," Mike Pence","It really is remarkable that they actually are advocating a trillion dollars in tax increases, which I get that."
"0.52"," Mike Pence","But a trillion dollars in tax increases, more regulation, more of the same war on coal, and more of Obamacare that now even former President Bill Clinton calls Obamacare a crazy plan."
"0.52"," Mike Pence","Well, look, I can defend -- I -- I -- I can -- I can make very clear to the American people, after traveling millions of miles as our secretary of state, after being the architect of the foreign policy of this administration, America is less safe today than it was the day that Barack Obama became president of the United States."
"0.52"," Mike Pence","Look, Donald Trump has filed over 100 pages of financial disclosure, which is what the law requires."
"0.51"," Tim Kaine","Hillary Clinton was first lady, then senator for eight years and secretary of state."
"0.51"," Mike Pence","When Donald Trump and I observe that, as I've said in Syria, in Iran, in Ukraine, that the small and bullying leader of Russia has been stronger on the world stage than this administration, that's stating painful facts."
"0.51"," Tim Kaine","It's, first, dramatically expanding our intelligence capacities by hiring great professionals, but also we've got some of the best intel and cyber employees in the world right here in the United States working for many of our private sector companies."
"0.51"," Mike Pence","He actually -- he actually tried to raise taxes by about $4 billion."
"0.51"," Tim Kaine","Richard Nixon released tax returns when he was under audit."
"0.51"," Mike Pence","And if Russia chooses to be involved and continue, I should say, to be involved in this barbaric attack on civilians in Aleppo, the United States of America should be prepared to use military force to strike military targets of the Assad regime to prevent them from this humanitarian crisis that is taking place in Aleppo."
"0.50"," Tim Kaine","But I've got a lot of scar tissue, because when I was governor of Virginia, there was a horrible shooting at Virginia Tech, and we learned that through that painful situation that gaps in the background record check system should have been closed and it could have prevented that crime, and so we're going to work to do things like close background record checks."
"0.50"," Mike Pence","He created a runway -- because he's created a business that's worth billions of dollars today."
"0.50"," Mike Pence","Well, Germany just arrested three Syrian refugees that were connected to ISIS."
"0.50"," Tim Kaine","That's another 4.5 million people."
"0.50"," Mike Pence","When we get back to 3.5 percent to 4 percent growth with Donald Trump's plan will do, then we're going to have the resources to meet our nation's needs at home and abroad, and we're going to have the ability to bring down the national debt."
"0.50"," Tim Kaine","The terrorist threat to United States troops has been decreased in some ways because there's not 175,000 in a dangerous part of the world."
"0.49"," Mike Pence","I mean, the situation we're watching hour by hour in Syria today is the result of the failed foreign policy and the weak foreign policy that Hillary Clinton helped lead in this administration and create."
"0.49"," Mike Pence","The reality is that there's heartbreak and tragedy that has struck American families because people that came into this country illegally are now involved in criminal enterprise and activity."
"0.49"," Mike Pence","... troops from Iraq, and ISIS was able to be conjured up in that vacuum."
"0.49"," Tim Kaine","It provides AIDS drugs to about 11.5 million people."
"0.49"," Tim Kaine","The Clinton Foundation is one of the highest- rated charities in the world."
"0.49"," Tim Kaine","She was part of the national security team that wiped out bin Laden."
"0.49"," Mike Pence","But the truth is, Osama bin Laden led Al Qaida."
"0.48"," Mike Pence","And when Donald Trump is president of the United States, we're -- we're not going to have the -- the kind of posture in the world that has Russia invading Crimea and Ukraine, that has the Chinese building new islands in the South China Sea, that has literally the world, including North Korea, flouting American power."
"0.48"," Tim Kaine","Every president since Richard Nixon has done it, and Donald Trump has said I'm doing business with Russia."
"0.48"," Tim Kaine","She went once famously to China and stood up at a human rights meeting and looked them in the eye and said, \""Women's rights are human rights.\"""
"0.48"," Tim Kaine","So they actually supported the sanctions package, even though many of the sanctions are against Chinese firms, Chinese financial institutions."
"0.48"," Mike Pence","His tax returns -- his tax returns showed he went through a very difficult time, but he used the tax code just the way it's supposed to be used."
"0.48"," Tim Kaine","Hillary Clinton has gone toe-to- toe with Russia."
"0.47"," Mike Pence","Senator, when African-American police officers involved in a police action shooting involving an African-American, why would Hillary Clinton accuse that African-American police officer of implicit bias?"
"0.47"," Mike Pence","He's employed tens of thousands of people in this country."
"0.47"," Mike Pence","The state of Indiana has balanced budgets."
"0.46"," Tim Kaine","She worked across the aisle after 9/11 to get health benefits for the first responders who bravely went into the towers and into the Pentagon."
"0.46"," Mike Pence","But because Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama failed to provide a status of forces agreement and leave sufficient troops in there, we are back at war."
"0.46"," Tim Kaine","He trash talks the military."
"0.46"," Mike Pence","Ronald Reagan also said nuclear war should never be fought because it can never be won."
"0.46"," Tim Kaine","I'm proud because her vision of stronger together, building an economy that works for all, not just those at the top, being safe in the world not only with a strong military, but also strong alliances to battle terrorism and climate change, and also to build a community of respect, just like Barbara Johns tried to do 65 years ago."
"0.46"," Mike Pence","And you heard one of the last things he mentioned was border security."
"0.46"," Mike Pence","She built the sanctions regime around the word that stopped the Iranian nuclear weapons program."
"0.46"," Mike Pence","It's worked in the Hoosier state."
"0.45"," Mike Pence","Most of the stuffy you've said, he's never said."
"0.45"," Tim Kaine","She went toe-to-toe with Russia as secretary of state to do the New START Agreement to reduce Russia's nuclear stockpile."
"0.45"," Tim Kaine","Even the Israeli military says it stopped."
"0.45"," Tim Kaine","Young men and women -- young men and women signed up to serve in the military to fight terrorism."
"0.45"," Tim Kaine","Then he survived the Soviet Union takeover of his country."
"0.45"," Mike Pence",".... calling half of Donald Trump's supporters a basket of deplorables."
"0.45"," Mike Pence","At a time when literally, in the wake of Hillary Clinton's tenure as secretary of state, where she was the architect of the Obama administration's foreign policy, we see entire portions of the world, particularly the wider Middle East, literally spinning out of control."
"0.45"," Mike Pence","We ought to deploy a missile defense shield to the Czech Republic and Poland which Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama pulled back on out of not wanting to offend the Russians back in 2009."
"0.45"," Tim Kaine","She went toe-to-toe with Russia and lodged protests when they went into Georgia."
"0.44"," Tim Kaine","Governor, President Bush said we would leave Iraq at the end of 2011."
"0.44"," Mike Pence","We were bringing them to heel, but the goal was always that we would only lift the sanctions if Iran permanently renounced their nuclear ambitions."
"0.44"," Tim Kaine","He stood on the stage last week and when Hillary said, you haven't been paying taxes, he said, \""That makes me smart.\"""
"0.44"," Tim Kaine","He said African-Americans are living in Hell."
"0.44"," Tim Kaine","Fifteen million new jobs?"
"0.44"," Tim Kaine","Fifteen million new jobs?"
"0.44"," Tim Kaine","We have a justice system that does that."
"0.44"," Mike Pence","But I think he's a very fitting running mate for Hillary Clinton, because in the wake of a season where American families are struggling in this economy under the weight of higher taxes and Obamacare and the war on coal and the stifling avalanche of regulation coming out of this administration, Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine want more of the same."
"0.44"," Tim Kaine","... improved dramatically between 2014 and 2015."
"0.44"," Tim Kaine","So you like the 16 million deportations?"
"0.44"," Tim Kaine","That may be the $64,000 question, because it has been a divisive campaign."
"0.43"," Tim Kaine","And I worked with Jesuit missionaries in Honduras, now nearly 35 years ago, and they were the heroes of my life."
"0.43"," Tim Kaine","He's called women slobs, pigs, dogs, disgusting."
"0.43"," Tim Kaine","... that Hillary was part of a team that got bin Laden."
"0.43"," Tim Kaine","Did he apologize for saying African-Americans are living in Hell?"
"0.43"," Tim Kaine","And we've done the same thing about Ukraine, but more than launching protests, we've put punishing economic sanctions on Russia that we need to continue."
"0.43"," Tim Kaine","Yes, we did."
"0.43"," Mike Pence","Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine want to increase the Syrian refugee program by 500..."
"0.43"," Tim Kaine","First, Donald Trump said wages are too high."
"0.43"," Mike Pence","The state of Indiana has also sought to make sure that we expand alternatives in health care counseling for women, non-abortion alternatives."
"0.43"," Tim Kaine","And look, criminal justice is about respecting the law and being respected by the law."
"0.43"," Tim Kaine","And I said about Aleppo, we do agree the notion is we have to create a humanitarian zone in northern Syria."
"0.42"," Tim Kaine","But when folks went and explored this situation, what they found is that Philando Castile, who was a -- they called him Mr. Rogers with Dreadlocks in the school that he worked."
"0.42"," Tim Kaine","I'm on the Foreign Relations Committee."
"0.42"," Tim Kaine","It gets higher rankings for its charity than the American Red Cross does."
"0.42"," Tim Kaine","First, we're going to protect Social Security, which is one of the greatest programs that the American government has ever done."
"0.42"," Mike Pence","But Hillary Clinton wants to -- wants to repeal the longstanding provision in the law where we said we wouldn't use taxpayer dollars to fund abortion."
"0.42"," Tim Kaine","His sons have said that the organization has a lot of business dealings in Russia."
"0.42"," Mike Pence","Donald Trump is committed to restoring the borders of this nation and securing our nation, enforcing our laws."
"0.42"," Tim Kaine","So it was Hillary Clinton who worked with Russia on the New START Treaty to reduce their nuclear weapons stockpile."
"0.42"," Tim Kaine","Even after President Bush stopped pushing for it, Congressman Pence kept pushing for it."
"0.42"," Tim Kaine","She worked to get benefits for -- TRICARE benefits for National Guard members, including Hoosiers and Virginians in the National Guard."
"0.42"," Tim Kaine","She worked a tough negotiation with nations around the world to eliminate the Iranian nuclear weapons program without firing a shot."
"0.42"," Mike Pence","Donald Trump's idea that more nations should get nuclear weapons, Saudi Arabia, Japan, South Korea."
"0.41"," Tim Kaine","The foundation was just fined for illegally contributing foundation dollars to a political campaign of a Florida attorney general."
"0.41"," Mike Pence","We've been talking it to death for 20 years."
"0.41"," Mike Pence","And the union for Immigrations and Customs Enforcement for the first time in their history endorsed Donald Trump to be the next president of the United States of America."
"0.41"," Tim Kaine","When Donald Trump says Mexicans are rapists and criminals, Mexican immigrants, when Donald Trump says about your judge, a Hoosier judge, he said that Judge Curiel was unqualified to hear a case because his parents were Mexican, I can't imagine how you could defend that."
"0.41"," Tim Kaine","He went after John McCain, a POW, and said he wasn't hero because he'd been captured."
"0.41"," Mike Pence","Ronald Reagan said something really interesting about nuclear proliferation back in the 1980s."
"0.41"," Tim Kaine","We even wiped out the leader of Al Qaida."
"0.41"," Tim Kaine","And Hillary Clinton as secretary of state acted in the interests of the United States."
"0.41"," Tim Kaine","He said he wants to put it on the ash heap of history."
"0.41"," Mike Pence","After the Russian reset, the Russians invaded Ukraine and took over Crimea."
"0.41"," Tim Kaine","Did he apologize for saying President Obama was not even a citizen of the United States?"
"0.41"," Tim Kaine","But Governor Pence said, inarguably, Vladimir Putin is a better leader than President Obama."
"0.41"," Tim Kaine","And that walkout led to the Brown v. Board of Education decision that moved us down the path toward equality."
"0.41"," Mike Pence","But I -- Donald Trump has a plan that he laid out in Arizona, that will deal systemically with illegal immigration, beginning with border security, internal enforcement."
"0.40"," Mike Pence","... and the fact that they got $1.7 billion in a ransom payment..."
"0.40"," Tim Kaine","You both have said -- you both have said Vladimir Putin is a better leader than the president."
"0.40"," Mike Pence","Yes."
"0.40"," Tim Kaine","Yes."
"0.40"," Mike Pence","He fell in Fallujah in 2005."
"0.40"," Tim Kaine","And paid few taxes and lost a billion a year."
"0.40"," Mike Pence","It's probably -- probably why the 330,000 members of the Fraternal Order of Police endorsed Donald Trump as the next president of the United States of America, because they see his commitment to them."
"0.40"," Tim Kaine","Governor Pence just said -- Governor Pence just said that Donald Trump will rebuild the military."
"0.40"," Tim Kaine","And we stopped a nuclear weapons program without a shot."
"0.40"," Tim Kaine","It's putting money into Donald Trump's pockets and into the pockets of his children, whereas the Clinton Foundation is a non- profit and no Clinton family member draws any salary."
"0.39"," Tim Kaine","He said, \""I have a secret plan,\"" and then he said, \""Um, I know more than all the generals about ISIL.\"""
"0.39"," Mike Pence","It begins by rebuilding our military."
"0.39"," Tim Kaine","The terrorist threat has decreased in some ways because an Iranian nuclear weapons program has been stopped."
"0.39"," Tim Kaine","We stopped Iran from getting nuclear weapons."
"0.39"," Mike Pence","And the Russians and the Chinese have been making enormous investments in the military."
"0.39"," Mike Pence","She had a Clinton Foundation accepting contributions from foreign governments."
"0.39"," Tim Kaine","We just did an extensive sanctions package against North Korea."
"0.39"," Tim Kaine","... to Donald Trump apologizing for calling women slobs, pigs, dogs, disgusting."
"0.39"," Mike Pence","He also said and many of them are good people."
"0.39"," Tim Kaine","And he perpetrated this outrageous and bigoted lie that President Obama is not a U.S. citizen."
"0.39"," Mike Pence","Because at a time of great challenge in the life of this nation, where we've weakened America's place in the world, stifled America's economy, the campaign of Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine has been an avalanche of insults."
"0.39"," Mike Pence","It has been a platform for the Clintons to travel the world, to have staff."
"0.39"," Tim Kaine","But can you defend Donald Trump's claim that more nations should get nuclear weapons?"
"0.39"," Mike Pence","Ronald Reagan said a nation without borders is not a nation."
"0.39"," Mike Pence","It begins with border security."
"0.38"," Mike Pence","I -- I signed criminal justice reform in the state of Indiana, Senator, and we're very proud of it."
"0.38"," Mike Pence","Or that -- I know you've historically opposed taxpayer funding of abortion."
"0.38"," Mike Pence","... slowest economic recovery since the Great Depression."
"0.38"," Tim Kaine","We will focus on -- and Hillary Clinton has rolled out a really comprehensive mental health reform package that she worked on with law enforcement professionals, and we will also fight the scourge of gun violence in the United States."
"0.38"," Tim Kaine","I was a governor of Virginia with two Republican houses."
"0.38"," Mike Pence","It's probably why for the first time in the history of Immigration and Customs Enforcement their union actually endorsed Donald Trump as the next president of the United States, because they know they need help to enforce the laws of this country."
"0.38"," Tim Kaine","And he had to be reminded that they had gone into the Crimea two years before."
"0.38"," Mike Pence","For the last seven-and-a-half years, we've seen America's place in the world weakened."
"0.38"," Mike Pence","... while she's secretary of state."
"0.38"," Tim Kaine","And Social Security has enabled people to retire with dignity and overwhelmingly not be in poverty."
"0.38"," Mike Pence","The president just ordered more troops on the ground."
"0.38"," Tim Kaine","Stopping a nuclear weapons program without firing a shot?"
"0.38"," Tim Kaine","More nations should get nuclear weapons."
"0.38"," Tim Kaine","Five components."
"0.37"," Mike Pence","I traveled in and out of that region for 10 years."
"0.37"," Tim Kaine","Donald Trump started this campaign in 2014 and he said, \""If I run for president, I will absolutely release my taxes.\"""
"0.37"," Tim Kaine","That's our proposal."
"0.37"," Tim Kaine","We have a son deployed overseas in the Marine Corps right now."
"0.37"," Tim Kaine","Do you know that Iran was racing toward a nuclear weapon and Russia was expanding its stockpile?"
"0.37"," Mike Pence","Hillary Clinton -- Hillary Clinton -- Hillary Clinton failed to renegotiate a status of forces agreement..."
"0.37"," Tim Kaine","It was very, very difficult to allow executions to go forward, but in circumstances where I didn't feel like there was a case for clemency, I told Virginia voters I would uphold the law, and I did."
"0.37"," Mike Pence","But they also -- they also hear the bad mouthing, the bad mouthing that comes from people that seize upon tragedy in the wake of police action shootings as -- as a reason to -- to use a broad brush to accuse law enforcement of -- of implicit bias or institutional racism."
"0.37"," Tim Kaine","That's what the Israeli joint chiefs of staff is saying right now."
"0.37"," Tim Kaine","We're going to stand up against efforts to privatize Social Security."
"0.37"," Mike Pence","... of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama."
"0.37"," Mike Pence","And that nation was secured in 2009."
"0.37"," Mike Pence","Put on top of that the kind of trade deals that'll put the American worker first, and you've got a prescription for real growth."
"0.37"," Mike Pence","She apologized for saying \""half.\"""
"0.37"," Tim Kaine","He built a business career, in the words of one of his own campaign staffers, \""off the backs of the little guy.\"""
"0.37"," Tim Kaine","Mike Pence and I both are descended from immigrant families."
"0.37"," Mike Pence","I mean, the truth of the matter is, the policies of this administration, which Hillary Clinton and Senator Kaine want to continue, have run this economy into a ditch."
"0.37"," Mike Pence","Indiana has passed criminal justice reform."
"0.37"," Tim Kaine","And he has been a one-man bulwark against minimum wage increases in Indiana."
"0.37"," Mike Pence","But the Clintons figured out a way to create a foundation where foreign governments and foreign donors could donate millions of dollars."
"0.36"," Tim Kaine","The terrorist threat has decreased in some ways, because bin Laden is dead."
"0.36"," Mike Pence","Donald Trump has paid all the taxes that he's -- do you not take deductions?"
"0.36"," Tim Kaine","One of those killed at Virginia Tech was a guy named Liviu Librescu."
"0.36"," Tim Kaine","From a time as a kid in a Methodist youth group in the suburbs of Chicago, she has been focused on serving others with a special focus on empowering families and kids."
"0.36"," Mike Pence","There are criminal aliens in this country, Tim, who have come into this country illegally who are perpetrating violence and taking American lives."
"0.36"," Tim Kaine","It helps Americans deal with opioid overdoses."
"0.36"," Mike Pence","The United States of America needs to begin to exercise strong leadership to protect the vulnerable citizens and over 100,000 children in Aleppo."
"0.36"," Tim Kaine","Donald Trump, on the other hand, didn't know that Russia had invaded the Crimea."
"0.36"," Mike Pence","He said he's stronger -- he's been stronger on the world stage."
"0.36"," Tim Kaine","America should really wonder about a President Trump, who had a campaign manager with ties to Putin, pro- Putin elements in the Ukraine, who had to be fired for that reason."
"0.36"," Tim Kaine","And yesterday an appellate court with three Republican judges struck down the Pence plan..."
"0.36"," Tim Kaine","The guy, Philando Castile, who was killed in St. Paul, he was a worker, a valued worker in a local school."
"0.36"," Mike Pence","Donald Trump and I would never support legislation that punished women who made the heartbreaking choice to end a pregnancy."
"0.36"," Tim Kaine","And when Congressman Pence was in Congress, he was the chief cheerleader for the privatization of Social Security."
"0.36"," Tim Kaine","NATO is obsolete, and we'll only work together with Israel if they pay \""big league.\"""
"0.36"," Mike Pence","But also, Donald Trump and I are committed to suspending the Syrian refugee program and programs and immigration from areas of the world that have been compromised by terrorism."
"0.35"," Mike Pence","And Iraq has been overrun by ISIS, because Hillary Clinton failed to renegotiate..."
"0.35"," Tim Kaine","And yet she stood up to them on issues such as Syria and their invasion of Georgia."
"0.35"," Mike Pence","Look, what -- what you all just heard out there is more taxes, $2 trillion in more spending, more deficits, more debt, more government."
"0.35"," Mike Pence","We've said we're going to meet the obligations of Medicare."
"0.35"," Tim Kaine","When I was running for governor, I was attacked pretty strongly because of my position on the death penalty."
"0.35"," Mike Pence","That's a little bit different than when Senator Kaine was governor here in Virginia."
"0.35"," Tim Kaine","Our plan is like Ronald Reagan's plan from 1986."
"0.35"," Tim Kaine","Hillary Clinton as secretary of state took no action to benefit the foundation."
"0.35"," Mike Pence","Foreign donors, and certainly foreign governments, cannot participate in the American political process."
"0.35"," Tim Kaine","And if you look at sentencing in this country, African-Americans and Latinos get sentenced for the same crimes at very different rates."
"0.35"," Tim Kaine","He attacked an Indiana-born federal judge and said he was unqualified to hear a federal lawsuit because his parents were Mexican."
"0.35"," Tim Kaine","When Donald Trump spoke in Phoenix, he looked the audience in the eye and he said, no, we're building a wall, and we're deporting everybody."
"0.35"," Tim Kaine","Do they have a passion in their life that showed up before they were in public life?"
"0.35"," Tim Kaine","Hillary Clinton has gone toe-to-toe with Russia to work out a deal on New START."
"0.35"," Mike Pence","All Donald Trump -- all Donald Trump and I have said about Social Security is we're going to meet our obligations to our seniors."
"0.35"," Tim Kaine","... has business dealings -- has business dealings with Russia that he refuses to disclose."
"0.35"," Tim Kaine","She was part of the team that got bin Laden, and she'll lead the team that will get Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the head of ISIS."
"0.35"," Tim Kaine","My 40th reunion is in 10 days."
"0.35"," Tim Kaine","They should wonder -- when Donald Trump is sitting down with Vladimir Putin, is it going to be America's bottom line or is it going to be Donald Trump's bottom line that he's going to be worried about with all of his business dealings?"
"0.35"," Tim Kaine","Fourth, we promote small business growth, just as we've done in Virginia, to make it easier to start and grow small businesses."
"0.34"," Mike Pence","We could put cybersecurity first if we just make sure the next secretary of state doesn't have a private server."
"0.34"," Mike Pence","We have got to do a better job recognizing and correcting the errors in the system that do reflect on institutional bias in criminal justice."
"0.34"," Mike Pence","I worked when I was Congress on a second chance act."
"0.34"," Tim Kaine","He doesn't want to acknowledge that we stopped the Iranian nuclear weapons program."
"0.34"," Tim Kaine","You build the bonds between the community and the police force, build bonds of understanding, and then when people feel comfortable in their communities, that gap between the police and the communities they serve narrows."

"0.34"," Tim Kaine","And in all six cases, he's refused to defend his running mate."
"0.34"," Mike Pence","We are back at war in Iraq."
"0.34"," Mike Pence","The only issue on taxes -- Hillary Clinton is going to raise taxes, and Donald Trump and I are going to cut them."
"0.34"," Tim Kaine","Now, this could be solved if Donald Trump would be willing to release his tax returns, as he told the American public that he would do."
"0.34"," Mike Pence","You know, I served in Washington, D.C., for 12 years in the Congress of the United States."
"0.34"," Tim Kaine","\""Go ahead, folks, enjoy yourselves.\"""
"0.34"," Mike Pence","Donald Trump knew that happened."
"0.34"," Mike Pence","Well, first and foremost, Donald Trump supports our troops."
"0.34"," Mike Pence","There are millions more people living in poverty today than the day that Barack Obama with Hillary Clinton at his side..."
"0.34"," Tim Kaine","And Hillary also has the ability to stand up to Russia in a way that this ticket does not."
"0.34"," Mike Pence","And the men and women, white, African-American, Asian, Latino, Hispanic, they put their lives on the line every single day."
"0.34"," Mike Pence","But what -- what -- what Donald Trump and I are saying is let's not have the reflex of assuming the worst of men and women in law enforcement."
"0.33"," Mike Pence","I served on the Foreign Affairs Committee for a decade."
"0.33"," Mike Pence","But like virtually every other business, including the New York Times not too long ago, he used what's called net operating loss."
"0.33"," Tim Kaine","And all investigation concluded that not one reasonable prosecutor would take any additional step."
"0.33"," Tim Kaine","Hillary and I want a bipartisan reform that will put keeping families together as the top goal, second, that will help focus enforcement efforts on those who are violent, third, that will do more border control, and, fourth, that will provide a path to citizenship for those who work hard, pay taxes, play by the rules, and take criminal background record checks."
"0.33"," Mike Pence","Hillary Clinton's top priority when she became secretary of state was the Russian reset, the Russians reset."
"0.33"," Mike Pence","Law enforcement in this country is a force for good."
"0.33"," Tim Kaine","Donald Trump during his campaign has called Mexicans rapists and criminals."
"0.33"," Mike Pence","And with Donald Trump -- Donald Trump's sons say that they have all these business dealings with Russia."
"0.33"," Mike Pence","Police officers are the best of us."
"0.33"," Mike Pence","He says ours is an insult-driven campaign."
"0.33"," Tim Kaine","And a Republican FBI director did an investigation and concluded that..."
"0.33"," Mike Pence","I'm also very pleased at the fact we're well on our way in Indiana to becoming the most pro-adoption state in America."
"0.32"," Tim Kaine","Third, he loves dictators."
"0.32"," Mike Pence","Eliminate the Iranian nuclear weapons program?"
"0.32"," Mike Pence","And all the while, all we do is fold our arms and say we're not having talks anymore."
"0.32"," Mike Pence","You didn't stop the nuclear weapons program."
"0.32"," Mike Pence","And I dreamed some day of representing my home town in Washington, D.C., but I -- honestly, Elaine, I never imagined -- never imagined I'd have the opportunity to be governor of the state that I love, let alone be sitting at a table like this in this kind of a position."
"0.32"," Mike Pence","I mean, Donald Trump has called for extreme vetting for people coming into this country so that we don't bring people into the United States who are hostile to our Bill of Rights freedoms, who are hostile to the American way life."
"0.32"," Mike Pence","And Donald Trump has laid out a priority to remove criminal aliens, remove people that have overstayed their visas."
"0.32"," Mike Pence","We have got to bring together the best resources of this country to understand that cyber warfare is the new warfare of the asymmetrical enemies that we face in this country."
"0.32"," Mike Pence","He's brought an extraordinary business acumen."
"0.32"," Mike Pence","They are the -- they truly are people that put their lives on the line every single day."
"0.32"," Tim Kaine","Second, he stood on the stage..."
"0.32"," Mike Pence","We're going to strengthen Immigrations and Customs Enforcements with more resources and more personnel to be able to do that."
"0.32"," Mike Pence","We didn't."
"0.32"," Mike Pence","He fought hard through some of the most difficult days in Operation Iraqi Freedom, and he paid the ultimate sacrifice to defend our freedom and secure that nation."
"0.32"," Tim Kaine","But he said he would release his tax returns."
"0.32"," Mike Pence","Donald Trump has said we're going to move those people out, people who've overstayed their visas."
"0.32"," Tim Kaine","She was there at the World Trade Center when they were still searching for victims and survivors."
"0.32"," Mike Pence","We've weakened America's place in the world."
"0.32"," Mike Pence","We ought to assure the public that we'll have a full and complete and transparent investigation whenever there's a loss of life because of police action."
"0.32"," Mike Pence","And Donald Trump's entire career has been about building."
"0.32"," Tim Kaine","Second, we've got to disrupt financing networks, third, disrupt their ability to recruit on the Internet, in their safe havens."
"0.32"," Tim Kaine","You did ask this question about debt, and the debt explosion on the Trump plan is much, much bigger than anything on the Clinton side."
"0.32"," Mike Pence","Look, America is stronger than Russia."
"0.32"," Tim Kaine","She said the test of a Clinton administration will not be the signing of a bill or the passage of a bill."
"0.32"," Mike Pence","They have not renounced their nuclear ambitions."
"0.32"," Tim Kaine","But it's not the giveaway tax relief to the folks at the top."
"0.32"," Mike Pence","He was my hero when I was growing up."
"0.32"," Mike Pence","The -- the safe zones would have to be -- as the senator said, there's already a framework for this that's been recognized by the international community."
"0.32"," Tim Kaine","She got them engaged on a meaningful way to cap Iran's nuclear weapons program."
"0.32"," Tim Kaine","Hillary Clinton has that passion."
"0.32"," Mike Pence","My mom and dad built a -- everything that matters in a small town in Southern Indiana."
"0.31"," Mike Pence","And he did it brilliantly."
"0.31"," Mike Pence","He actually built a business."
"0.31"," Tim Kaine","Before Roe v. Wade, states could pass criminal laws to do just that, to punish women if they made the choice to terminate a pregnancy."
"0.31"," Tim Kaine","He wouldn't support troops."
"0.31"," Tim Kaine","China's another one of those relationships where it's competitive, it's also challenging, and in times like North Korea, we have to be able to cooperate."
"0.31"," Tim Kaine","... and Saddam Hussein."
"0.31"," Tim Kaine","He wants to tear up alliances."
"0.31"," Mike Pence","Senator, that was even beneath you and Hillary Clinton."
"0.31"," Tim Kaine","Some things, you know, maybe weren't said so great about the Irish when they came, but we've done well by absorbing immigrants, and it's made our nation stronger."
"0.31"," Tim Kaine","So it involves increasing our own workforce, but striking great partnerships with some of our cyber and intel experts in the private sector so that we can, consistent with constitutional principles, gather more intelligence."
"0.31"," Tim Kaine","Did Donald Trump apologize for taking after somebody in a Twitter war and making fun of her weight?"
"0.31"," Mike Pence","... guaranteed that Iran will someday become a nuclear power, because there's no limitations once the period of time of the treaty comes off."
"0.31"," Tim Kaine","And we have some young people in the audience who weren't even born when Roe was decided."
"0.31"," Tim Kaine","And then Hillary used them to get a deal."
"0.31"," Tim Kaine","Hillary and I each grew up in small-business families."
"0.30"," Tim Kaine","First thing we do is we invest in manufacturing, infrastructure, and research in the clean energy jobs of tomorrow."
"0.30"," Mike Pence","Donald Trump's laid out a plan to end illegal immigration once and for all in this country."
"0.30"," Tim Kaine","And the poverty level and the median income..."
"0.30"," Tim Kaine","Because the FBI did an investigation."
"0.30"," Mike Pence","Senator, do you take all the deductions that you're entitled to?"
"0.30"," Tim Kaine","But I don't believe in this nation, a First Amendment nation, where we don't raise any religion over the other, and we allow people to worship as they please, that the doctrines of any one religion should be mandated for everyone."
"0.30"," Tim Kaine","And I'm really amazed, Elaine, as I talk to Republican senators, how well they regard and respect Hillary Clinton."
"0.30"," Tim Kaine","Governor Pence had to give Donald Trump his tax returns to show he was qualified to be vice president."
"0.30"," Tim Kaine","He doesn't have a plan."
"0.30"," Mike Pence","When Donald Trump becomes president of the United States, the Russians and other countries in the world will know they're dealing with a strong American president."
"0.30"," Tim Kaine","And he was killed for no apparent reason in an incident that will be discussed and will be investigated."
"0.30"," Mike Pence","I mean, the reality is, when she was secretary of state, Senator, come on."
"0.30"," Tim Kaine","And when that gap narrows, it's safer for the communities and it's safer for the police."
"0.30"," Mike Pence","Well, he said NATO is obsolete."
"0.30"," Tim Kaine","The Trump organization is an octopus-like organization with tentacles all over the world whose conflict of interests could only be known if Donald Trump would release his tax returns."
"0.30"," Mike Pence","When Donald Trump says women should be punished or Mexicans are rapists and criminals..."
"0.30"," Tim Kaine","Then why did Donald Trump say that?"
"0.30"," Mike Pence","You boycotted the speech."
"0.30"," Tim Kaine","And that is the fundamental difference between a Clinton-Kaine ticket and a Trump- Pence ticket that wants to punish women who make that choice."
"0.30"," Mike Pence","Well, I have the deepest respect for Senator Scott, and he's a close friend."
"0.30"," Mike Pence","We just -- we just had a conversation about law enforcement."
"0.30"," Mike Pence","And to see the weak and feckless leadership that Hillary Clinton was the architect of and the foreign policy of the Obama administration..."
"0.29"," Mike Pence","These were Donald's -- hold on a second, Governor."
"0.29"," Tim Kaine","Intelligence surge is two-thirds, Elaine."
"0.29"," Mike Pence","My grandfather had immigrated to this country when he was about my son's age."
"0.29"," Mike Pence","They see his commitment to law and order."
"0.29"," Mike Pence","Well, he never said that, Senator."
"0.29"," Tim Kaine","It is about our troops."
"0.29"," Tim Kaine","It is about our troops."
"0.29"," Tim Kaine","He persecutes LGBT folks and journalists."
"0.29"," Tim Kaine","He was on a TV show a couple months back, and he said, \""I'll guarantee you this, Russia's not going into the Ukraine.\"""
"0.29"," Tim Kaine","Donald Trump is avoiding paying taxes."
"0.29"," Tim Kaine","Why doesn't Donald Trump trust women to make this choice for themselves?"
"0.29"," Mike Pence","... about drone strikes, e-mails from the president of the United States of America were on there."
"0.29"," Mike Pence","No, he hasn't said that."
"0.29"," Mike Pence","We're going to enforce the law of this country."
"0.29"," Mike Pence","But I will also tell you that it's important in this moment to remember that Hillary Clinton had a private server in her home that had classified information on it..."
"0.29"," Mike Pence","We've got to work with Congress, and Donald Trump will, to rebuild our military and project American strength in the world."
"0.29"," Mike Pence","I was also raised in a wonderful family of faith."
"0.29"," Mike Pence","What we're dealing with is the -- you know, there's an old proverb that says the Russian bear never dies, it just hibernates."
"0.29"," Mike Pence","... reform government programs so we can meet the obligations of Social Security and Medicare."
"0.29"," Mike Pence","But for me, I would tell you that for me the sanctity of life proceeds out of the belief that -- that ancient principle that -- where God says before you were formed in the womb, I knew you, and so for my first time in public life, I sought to stand with great compassion for the sanctity of life."
"0.29"," Tim Kaine","This is the difference between a foundation that does good work and a secretary of state who acted in accordance with American interest and somebody who is conflicted and doing work around the world and won't share with the American public what he's doing and what those conflicts are."
"0.29"," Mike Pence","Donald Trump and I are going to make sure that law enforcement have the resources and the tools to be able to really restore law and order to the cities and communities in this nation."
"0.29"," Mike Pence","We have an intelligence, sir ."
"0.29"," Tim Kaine","We can support the Second Amendment and do things like background record checks and make us safer, and that will make police safer, too."
"0.29"," Mike Pence","It was a failure of the secretary of state..."
"0.29"," Tim Kaine","Donald Trump and Mike Pence have said he's a great leader."
"0.29"," Mike Pence","Well, I think Donald Trump laid out a series of priorities that doesn't ends with border security."
"0.29"," Mike Pence","It's -- she said they were irredeemable, they were not American."
"0.29"," Tim Kaine","That's why Donald Trump's claim that he wants to -- that NATO is obsolete and that we need to get rid of NATO is so dangerous."
"0.29"," Tim Kaine","Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Japan."
"0.29"," Tim Kaine","They made an illegal contribution, and then they tried to hide it by disguising it to somebody else."
"0.28"," Tim Kaine","He's said Saudi Arabia should get them, Japan should get them, Korea should get them."
"0.28"," Tim Kaine","And we'll look for strategies like adjusting the payroll tax cap upward in order to do that."
"0.28"," Tim Kaine","That's incorrect."
"0.28"," Tim Kaine","Sorry."
"0.28"," Mike Pence","But, Senator, please, you know, enough of this seeking every opportunity to demean law enforcement broadly by making the accusation of implicit bias every time tragedy occurs."
"0.28"," Tim Kaine","But the last thing, the very last thing that government should do is have laws that would punish women who make reproductive choices."
"0.28"," Mike Pence","... the reason the American people don't trust Hillary Clinton is because they are looking at the pay to play politics that she operated with the Clinton Foundation through a private server..."
"0.28"," Tim Kaine","Six times tonight, I have said to Governor Pence I can't imagine how you can defend your running mate's position on one issue after the next."
"0.28"," Tim Kaine","The kids loved him."
"0.28"," Tim Kaine","Vladimir Putin has run his economy into the ground."
"0.28"," Tim Kaine","The military is a disaster, John McCain's no hero, the generals need all to be fired, and I know more than them."
"0.28"," Mike Pence","And -- and once we have accomplished all of that, which will -- which will strengthen our economy, strengthen the rule of law in the country and make our communities safer once the criminal aliens are out, then we'll deal with those that remain."
"0.28"," Tim Kaine","When a guy running for president will not support the troops, not support veterans, not support teachers, that's really important."
"0.28"," Mike Pence","And after we secure the border, not only build a wall, but beneath the ground and in the air, we do internal enforcement."
"0.28"," Tim Kaine","And I was elected, and I did."
"0.28"," Tim Kaine","From the fullness of the heart, the mouth speaks."
"0.28"," Tim Kaine","These guys -- and Donald Trump have said it -- deportation force."
"0.28"," Tim Kaine","And yet he is asking everybody to vote for somebody that he cannot defend."
"0.28"," Mike Pence","ISIS is headquartered in Raqqa."
"0.28"," Tim Kaine","I was a city councilman and mayor in Richmond."
"0.28"," Tim Kaine","You are Donald Trump's apprentice."
"0.28"," Mike Pence","And then, of course, Syria, I mean, it really is extraordinary that -- Syria is imploding."
"0.28"," Tim Kaine","I'm a strong Second Amendment supporter."
"0.28"," Tim Kaine","But why don't you trust women?"
"0.28"," Tim Kaine","But let's compare this now with the Trump organization and the Trump Foundation."
"0.28"," Tim Kaine","No, he said leader."
"0.28"," Tim Kaine","It also means creating stronger alliances, because you gather intelligence and then you share your intelligence back and forth with allies."
"0.28"," Tim Kaine","You've got to have the ability to do that, and Hillary does."
"0.28"," Mike Pence","It's absolutely true."
"0.28"," Mike Pence","And we also need -- we also need an effective American diplomacy that will marshal the resources of nations in the Asian Pacific Rim to put pressure on North Korea, on Kim Jong-un, to abandon his nuclear ambitions."
"0.28"," Mike Pence","You just asked a very thoughtful question about the disaster in Aleppo."
"0.28"," Mike Pence","He's talking about criminal aliens."
"0.28"," Mike Pence","And I think that's who Governor Pence's running mate is, exactly who Governor Reagan warned us about."
"0.28"," Mike Pence","And come on."
"0.28"," Tim Kaine","Hillary Clinton went to Washington to get funds to rebuild her city and protect first responders, but Donald Trump was fighting a very different fight."
"0.28"," Mike Pence","You use that a whole lot."
"0.28"," Tim Kaine","And finally he said, \""I'm going to fire all the generals.\"""
"0.28"," Tim Kaine","But there are other parts of the world that are challenging."
"0.28"," Tim Kaine","He's broken his first..."
"0.28"," Tim Kaine","By trashing all Syrians or trashing all Muslims?"
"0.28"," Mike Pence","And I served with many Republicans and Democrats, men and women of goodwill."
"0.28"," Mike Pence","You tried to raise taxes here in Virginia and were unsuccessful."
"0.28"," Mike Pence","That's small potatoes compared to Hillary Clinton..."
"0.27"," Tim Kaine","The Clinton foundation does an awful lot of good work."
"0.27"," Mike Pence","... stepped into the Oval Office."
"0.27"," Mike Pence","We're going to put the safety and security of the American people first."
"0.27"," Tim Kaine","Hillary and I have a plan that's on the table that's a \""you're hired\"" plan."
"0.27"," Tim Kaine","Donald Trump doesn't have a plan."
"0.27"," Mike Pence","And then Donald Trump has made it clear, once we've done all of those things, that we're going to reform the immigration system that we have..."
"0.27"," Tim Kaine","Donald Trump always puts himself first."
"0.27"," Tim Kaine","Elaine -- Elaine, people shouldn't be afraid to bring up issues of bias in law enforcement."
"0.27"," Tim Kaine","I visited him in his office."
"0.27"," Tim Kaine","It's smart not to pay for teachers?"
"0.27"," Tim Kaine","Donald Trump wrote a book and he said Social Security is a Ponzi scheme and privatization would be good for all of us."
"0.27"," Tim Kaine","Syria."
"0.27"," Mike Pence","He said he's..."
"0.27"," Tim Kaine","Governor, why don't you trust women to make this choice for themselves?"
"0.27"," Tim Kaine","But the second piece of this is really, really important."
"0.27"," Tim Kaine","Because his tax plan basically helps him."
"0.27"," Mike Pence","And that -- that's pretty low."
"0.27"," Tim Kaine","And if he ever met his promise and he gave his tax returns to the American public like he said he would, we would see just how much his economic plan is really a Trump-first plan."
"0.27"," Mike Pence","Come on."
"0.27"," Tim Kaine","He's broken his first promise."
"0.27"," Tim Kaine","It's a \""you're fired\"" plan."
"0.27"," Mike Pence","And I want to give this president credit for bringing Osama bin Laden to justice."
"0.27"," Mike Pence","But here -- Hillary Clinton and her husband set up a private foundation called the Clinton Foundation."
"0.27"," Mike Pence","We're going to rebuild our military."
"0.27"," Mike Pence","It's amnesty."
"0.27"," Tim Kaine","He had survived the Holocaust."
"0.27"," Mike Pence","I know you boycotted Prime Minister Netanyahu's speech when he came before the Congress."
"0.27"," Mike Pence","We're in the..."
"0.27"," Tim Kaine","The Trump campaign management team had to be fired a month or so ago because of those shadowy connections with pro-Putin forces."
"0.27"," Tim Kaine","And we don't think that women should be punished, as Donald Trump said they should, for making the decision to have an abortion."
"0.27"," Mike Pence","He said the problem with nuclear proliferation is that some fool or maniac could trigger a catastrophic event."
"0.27"," Tim Kaine","He said, quote, \""They will all be gone.\"""
"0.27"," Tim Kaine","You both have said..."
"0.27"," Mike Pence","That's not an endorsement of Vladimir Putin."
"0.27"," Mike Pence","And Scott Zubowski, whose mom would always come to Memorial Day events in Newcastle, Indiana, to see me, and I'd give her a hug and tell her we're never going to forget her son and we never will, Scott Zubowski and the sacrifices the American soldier made were squandered in Iraq because this administration created a vacuum in which ISIS was able to grow."
"0.27"," Tim Kaine","And if we do, we won't have the tragedies that we did."
"0.27"," Tim Kaine","Donald Trump can't start a Twitter war with Miss Universe without shooting himself in the foot."
"0.27"," Tim Kaine","Donald Trump recently said we need to do more stop-and-frisk around the country."
"0.27"," Tim Kaine","She made history by protesting school segregation."
"0.27"," Tim Kaine","But -- but you have a voting record, Governor."
"0.27"," Tim Kaine","And last and most dangerously, Donald Trump believes -- Donald Trump believes that the world will be safer if more nations have nuclear weapons."
"0.27"," Tim Kaine","We're having fun up here."
"0.27"," Mike Pence","I'm not afraid to bring that up."
"0.27"," Tim Kaine","No, that is incorrect."
"0.27"," Mike Pence","... on the day that Iran released four American hostages..."
"0.26"," Mike Pence","The newly emboldened -- the aggression of Russia, whether it was in Ukraine or now they're heavy-handed approach..."
"0.26"," Mike Pence","Absolutely true."
"0.26"," Tim Kaine","You've been a lieutenant governor and governor and now a U.S. senator."
"0.26"," Tim Kaine","Donald Trump's son says that the Trump organization..."
"0.26"," Mike Pence","And they raised a family."
"0.26"," Mike Pence","It's been about -- it's going through hardship just like a businessperson does and finding a way through smarts and ingenuity and resilience to fight forward and -- when Donald Trump becomes president of the United States, we're going to have a stronger America."
"0.26"," Tim Kaine","In addition, Donald Trump has a foundation."
"0.26"," Tim Kaine","And, you know, Elaine, I have the same track record."
"0.26"," Tim Kaine","These guys have praised Vladimir Putin as a great leader."
"0.26"," Tim Kaine","Third, we promote fairness by raising the minimum wage, so you can't work full-time and be under the poverty level, and by paying women equal pay for equal work."
"0.26"," Mike Pence","They give virtually every cent in the Trump Foundation to charitable causes."
"0.26"," Mike Pence","It's not more spending..."
"0.26"," Mike Pence","Most of what you said is completely false, and the American people know that."
"0.26"," Tim Kaine","He absolutely said it."
"0.26"," Mike Pence","And he's going -- Senator, he's going to release his tax returns when the audit is over..."
"0.26"," Tim Kaine","And it's clear that he has business dealings with Russian oligarchs who are very connected to Putin."
"0.26"," Mike Pence","Her private server was subject to being hacked by foreign..."
"0.26"," Tim Kaine","That's shared."
"0.26"," Tim Kaine","But she's also worked on a lot of diplomatic and important diplomatic deals with China."
"0.26"," Tim Kaine","Remember, Hillary Clinton was the senator from New York on 9/11."
"0.26"," Mike Pence","And for all the world, Hillary Clinton just thinks Obamacare is a good start."
"0.26"," Mike Pence","It's been a combination of factors, but mostly it's been a lack of leadership."
"0.26"," Mike Pence","My heart breaks for the likes of Lance Cpl."
"0.26"," Tim Kaine","He's got kind of a personal Mount Rushmore, Vladimir Putin, Kim Jong-un, Moammar Gadhafi..."
"0.26"," Mike Pence","Ours is an insult-driven campaign?"
"0.26"," Tim Kaine","That's something we trust American women to do that."
"0.26"," Tim Kaine","So it's smart not to pay for our military?"
"0.26"," Mike Pence","The Trump Foundation is non-profit."
"0.26"," Tim Kaine","He's refused to do it."
"0.26"," Mike Pence","And we're saddened at the loss of life."
"0.26"," Tim Kaine","But then he was a visiting professor at Virginia Tech, and he couldn't survive the scourge of gun violence."
"0.26"," Tim Kaine","No, I visited him in his office."
"0.26"," Mike Pence","Donald Trump supports our veterans."
"0.26"," Mike Pence","The United States of America needs to be prepared to work with our allies in the region to create a route for safe passage and then to protect people in those areas, including with a no-fly zone."
"0.26"," Tim Kaine","Why did he say that?"
"0.26"," Tim Kaine","They want to go house to house, school to school, business to business, and kick out 16 million people."
"0.26"," Tim Kaine","Elaine, on the economy, there's a fundamental choice for the American electorate."
"0.26"," Mike Pence","You haven't seen his tax returns."
"0.26"," Mike Pence","Donald Trump and I are going to cut taxes."
"0.26"," Tim Kaine","If you want to have a society where people are respected and respect laws, you can't have somebody at the top who demeans every group that he talks about."
"0.26"," Tim Kaine","Business dealings."
"0.26"," Tim Kaine","The Trump plan is a different plan."
"0.25"," Tim Kaine","And interestingly enough, Elaine, the U.N. followed and did this -- virtually the same package."
"0.25"," Mike Pence","Oh, please."
"0.25"," Tim Kaine","He was a 70-plus-year-old Romanian Holocaust survivor."
"0.25"," Mike Pence","Because that had a lot of really creative lines in it."
"0.25"," Mike Pence","Look, to get to your question about trustworthiness, Donald Trump has built a business through hard times and through good times."
"0.25"," Mike Pence","They call it comprehensive immigration reform -- they call it comprehensive immigration reform on Capitol Hill."
"0.25"," Mike Pence","Elaine, the director of the FBI, our homeland security, said we can't know for certain who these people are coming from Syria."
"0.25"," Tim Kaine","We trust Hillary Clinton as president and commander-in-chief, but the thought of Donald Trump as commander-in-chief scares us to death."
"0.25"," Mike Pence","... and overrun vast areas of Iraq."
"0.25"," Mike Pence","And I think your running mate used a lot of pre-done lines."
"0.25"," Mike Pence","I mean, this economy is struggling."
"0.25"," Tim Kaine","We should focus upon danger, not upon discrimination."
"0.25"," Tim Kaine","She believed our nation was stronger together."
"0.25"," Tim Kaine","And remember, the Trump organization is not a non-profit."
"0.25"," Tim Kaine","It's smart not to pay for veterans?"
"0.25"," Tim Kaine","If Governor Pence wants to put more troops back in Iraq, that's..."
"0.25"," Mike Pence","And I've tried to live that out however imperfectly every day of my life since."
"0.25"," Mike Pence","She said she shouldn't have said half."
"0.25"," Tim Kaine","... we should not be able to bring up and talk about bias in the system, we'll never solve the problem..."
"0.25"," Tim Kaine","But I looked the voters of Virginia in the eye and said, look, this is my religion."
"0.25"," Mike Pence","That's it."
"0.25"," Tim Kaine","We support the constitutional right of American women to consult their own conscience, their own supportive partner, their own minister, but then make their own decision about pregnancy."
"0.25"," Tim Kaine","Governor Pence wants to repeal Roe v. Wade."
"0.25"," Mike Pence","We need criminal justice reform."
"0.25"," Tim Kaine","It happened at a time when you would work your whole life, your whole life, raising your kids, working, being a Little League coach or a Sunday school teacher, and then you would retire into poverty."
"0.25"," Mike Pence","And if I'm vice president of the United States or Donald Trump is president, we're going to put the safety and security of the American people first."
"0.25"," Mike Pence","We've seen an economy stifled by more taxes, more regulation, a war on coal, and a failing health care reform come to be known as Obamacare, and the American people know that we need to make a change."
"0.25"," Tim Kaine","And then he said, \""I'm going to call the generals to help me figure out a plan.\"""
"0.25"," Mike Pence","We're going to cut your taxes."
"0.25"," Mike Pence","They want to expand it into a single-payer program."
"0.25"," Tim Kaine","Do you want a \""you're hired\"" president in Hillary Clinton or do you want a \""you're fired\"" president in Donald Trump?"
"0.25"," Mike Pence","And with my wife at my side, we've followed a calling into public service, where we've -- we've tried to -- we've tried to keep faith with the values that we cherish."
"0.25"," Mike Pence","They want to see us supporting our military, rebuilding our military, commanding the respect of the world, and they want to see the American economy off to the races again."
"0.25"," Tim Kaine","He has, actually."
"0.25"," Tim Kaine","We will never, ever engage in a risky scheme to privatize Social Security."
"0.25"," Tim Kaine","And the person they donated to was somebody whose office was charged with investigating Trump University."
"0.25"," Mike Pence","Hillary Clinton is the secretary of state who knows how to build alliances."
"0.25"," Tim Kaine","Or instead of you violating the Constitution by blocking people based on their national origin rather than whether they're dangerous."
"0.25"," Tim Kaine","It was a fight to avoid paying taxes so that he wouldn't support the fight against terror."
"0.25"," Tim Kaine","Sixty-five years ago, a young, courageous woman, Barbara Johns, led a walkout of her high school, Moton High School."
"0.24"," Tim Kaine","I was educated by Jesuits at Rockhurst High School in Kansas City."
"0.24"," Tim Kaine","And then when I was governor of Virginia, we worked hard, too."
"0.24"," Mike Pence","I saw the clouds of smoke rise from the Pentagon."
"0.24"," Tim Kaine","I cannot believe that Governor Pence would sit here and defend his running mate's claim that we should create a deportation force to -- so that they'll all be gone."
"0.24"," Tim Kaine","Look for Donald trump apologizing to John McCain for saying he wasn't a hero..."
"0.24"," Tim Kaine","Donald Trump believes in deportation nation."
"0.24"," Tim Kaine","You asked the question about how do we deal with a North Korea."
"0.24"," Tim Kaine","Often China will use their veto in the Security Council to veto a package like that."
"0.24"," Mike Pence","That's the order that you should do it."
"0.24"," Mike Pence","It really is remarkable."
"0.24"," Mike Pence","We have a tax code, Senator, that actually is designed to encourage entrepreneurship in this country."
"0.24"," Mike Pence","If your son or my son handled classified information the way Hillary Clinton did..."
"0.24"," Mike Pence","And the United States of America needs to make investments in modernizing our nuclear force for both deterrence..."
"0.24"," Mike Pence","You know, my uncle was a cop, a career cop, on the beat in downtown Chicago."
"0.24"," Mike Pence","Hillary Clinton said her number-one priority was a reset with Russia."
"0.24"," Mike Pence","We just never would."
"0.24"," Mike Pence","That's not his plan."
"0.24"," Tim Kaine","Absolutely, without firing a shot."
"0.24"," Tim Kaine","And we did something we had really wanted to do."
"0.24"," Mike Pence","Americans need to worry about whether Donald Trump will be watching out for America's bottom line or his own bottom line."
"0.24"," Mike Pence","And we fully support that."
"0.24"," Tim Kaine","You've got to -- we do have to deal with Russia in a lot of different ways."
"0.24"," Tim Kaine","And that's a sharp contrast with Donald Trump."
"0.24"," Mike Pence","Donald Trump -- that's nonsense."
"0.24"," Tim Kaine","And they concluded that there was no reasonable prosecutor who would take it further."
"0.24"," Tim Kaine","He's not a leader."
"0.24"," Tim Kaine","The way you make communities safer and the way you make police safer is through community policing."
"0.24"," Tim Kaine","You guys love Russia."
"0.24"," Mike Pence","He knew that."
"0.24"," Mike Pence","The Trump Foundation is a private family foundation."
"0.24"," Mike Pence","That's nonsense."
"0.24"," Mike Pence","That's nonsense."
"0.24"," Mike Pence","If he wants to take these one at a time, I'll take them one at a time."
"0.24"," Mike Pence","And let my say, at the risk of agreeing with you, community policing is a great idea."
"0.24"," Tim Kaine","Go read -- go read the book."
"0.24"," Tim Kaine","If a nation where our troops are serving does not want us to stay, we're not going to stay without their protection."
"0.24"," Mike Pence","And so we removed -- we removed all of our..."
"0.24"," Mike Pence","And that's to bring a lifetime of experience, a lifetime growing up in a small town, a lifetime where I've served in the Congress of the United States, where -- where I've led a state that works in the great state of Indiana, and whatever other responsibilities might follow from this, I -- I would hope and, frankly, I would pray to be able to meet that moment with that -- that lifetime of experience."
"0.24"," Mike Pence","... their heavy-handed approach."
"0.24"," Tim Kaine","And Hillary Clinton has a track record of accomplishment across the aisle that will enable her to do just that when we work with the new Congress in January."
"0.24"," Tim Kaine","Hillary and I are both people out of religious backgrounds, from Methodist church experience, which was really formative for her as a public servant."
"0.24"," Tim Kaine","But we do have to bring the country together."
"0.24"," Mike Pence","America's political system is superior to the crony, corrupt capitalist system in Russia in every way."
"0.24"," Mike Pence","They cannot make financial contributions."
"0.23"," Tim Kaine","And she said to me, you've been a missionary and a civil rights lawyer."
"0.23"," Tim Kaine","We will work together in whatever roles we inhabit."
"0.23"," Mike Pence","First, Donald Trump just spoke about this issue this week."
"0.23"," Tim Kaine","Go read the book."
"0.23"," Mike Pence","I saw what the American soldier won in Operation Iraqi Freedom."
"0.23"," Mike Pence","And they're saying enough is enough."
"0.23"," Mike Pence","Look, this is the alternative universe of Washington, D.C., versus reality."
"0.23"," Tim Kaine","... put a program in place to keep them out if they're from Syria."
"0.23"," Mike Pence","The FBI and homeland security said we can't know for certain."
"0.23"," Tim Kaine","We support Roe v. Wade."
"0.23"," Tim Kaine","But why won't he release his tax returns?"
"0.23"," Tim Kaine","That's what the Seventh Circuit decided just -- here's the difference, Elaine."
"0.23"," Mike Pence","I mean, it's extraordinary."
"0.23"," Mike Pence","And what I would say is that we -- we need to adopt criminal justice reform nationally."
"0.23"," Mike Pence","Scott Zubowski."
"0.23"," Tim Kaine","Donald Trump."
"0.23"," Mike Pence","And we'd go up to visit my dad's family in Chicago."
"0.23"," Mike Pence","Well, that's not what -- that's not what Israel thinks."
"0.23"," Tim Kaine","I am so proud to be running with another strong, history-making woman, Hillary Clinton, to be president of the United States."
"0.23"," Mike Pence","And when the deal's period runs out, there's no limitation on them obtaining weapons."
"0.23"," Tim Kaine","You want to -- you want to use a big broad brush against Mexicans on that?"
"0.23"," Mike Pence","It's called Immigrations and Customs Enforcement."
"0.23"," Tim Kaine","And we'll look for ways to keep it solvent going forward, focusing primarily on the payroll tax cap."
"0.23"," Tim Kaine","First, we've got to keep taking out their leaders on the battlefield."
"0.23"," Tim Kaine","I'm really fortunate."
"0.23"," Mike Pence","No, we haven't."
"0.23"," Tim Kaine","To beat terrorism, there's only one candidate who can do it, and it's Hillary Clinton."
"0.23"," Mike Pence","But honestly, Senator, we would know a lot more about it if Hillary Clinton would just turn over the 33,000 e-mails..."
"0.23"," Mike Pence","Oh, that's nonsense."
"0.23"," Mike Pence","There are so many families around the country who can't have children."
"0.23"," Tim Kaine","Hillary understands that very well."
"0.23"," Mike Pence","I do."
"0.23"," Mike Pence","More and more young people today are embracing life because we know we are -- we're better for it."
"0.23"," Mike Pence","It was a church on Sunday morning and grace before dinner."
"0.23"," Tim Kaine","We won't do it based on discriminating against you from the country you come from or the religion that you practice."
"0.23"," Mike Pence","And, I mean, Hillary Clinton and Senator Kaine -- God bless you for it, career public servants, that's great -- Donald Trump is a businessman, not a career politician."
"0.23"," Mike Pence","My three brothers and I would marvel at my uncle when he would come out in his uniform, sidearm at his side."
"0.23"," Mike Pence","No, it's really not."
"0.23"," Tim Kaine","That's a really important one."
"0.23"," Tim Kaine","Immigration."
"0.23"," Tim Kaine","And I relish that role."
"0.23"," Tim Kaine","Vladimir Putin is a dictator."
"0.23"," Tim Kaine","Vladimir Putin is a dictator."
"0.22"," Tim Kaine","This is a very challenging part of the world, and we ought to have a commander-in-chief who is prepared and done it, rather than somebody who goes around praising Vladimir Putin as a great leader."
"0.22"," Tim Kaine","I think we put a lot on police shoulders."
"0.22"," Tim Kaine","Donald Trump must give the American public his tax returns to show that he's qualified to be president."
"0.22"," Tim Kaine","OK."
"0.22"," Tim Kaine","OK."
"0.22"," Mike Pence","But Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine want to build on Obamacare."
"0.22"," Mike Pence","We just had a conversation about the -- the violence that's besetting our cities."
"0.22"," Mike Pence","We truly do believe that law enforcement is not a force for racism or division in our country..."
"0.22"," Tim Kaine","If we -- look, a president should take action to defend the United States against imminent threat."
"0.22"," Mike Pence","And when that happens, the American people are going to stand tall, stand together, and we'll have the kind of unity that's been missing for way too long."
"0.22"," Tim Kaine","Great line from the -- great line from the gospel of Matthew."
"0.22"," Tim Kaine","Go to the tape."
"0.22"," Mike Pence","Those could be disclosed with tax returns, but they refuse to do them."
"0.22"," Mike Pence","... done well in some focus group."
"0.22"," Tim Kaine","These guys say all Mexicans are bad."
"0.22"," Tim Kaine","And Donald Trump has business..."
"0.22"," Mike Pence","I truly do."
"0.22"," Mike Pence","Do you?"
"0.22"," Mike Pence","And when you get the economy growing, Elaine, that's when you can deal with the national debt."
"0.22"," Tim Kaine","We'll focus on community policing."
"0.22"," Mike Pence","But he said the focus has to be on criminal aliens."
"0.22"," Tim Kaine","There's two plans on the table."
"0.22"," Tim Kaine","Alliances are critical."
"0.22"," Tim Kaine","He won't pay taxes."
"0.22"," Tim Kaine","That's what Donald Trump thinks."
"0.22"," Tim Kaine","And, Elaine, Iraq didn't want our troops to stay, and they wouldn't give us the protection for our troops."
"0.22"," Tim Kaine","Donald Trump said keep them out if they're Muslim."
"0.22"," Mike Pence","And he's paid payroll taxes, sales taxes, property taxes..."
"0.22"," Tim Kaine","You've been a city councilman and mayor."
"0.22"," Mike Pence","... keep that pay to play process out of the reach of the public."
"0.22"," Tim Kaine","You're going to raise taxes on the middle class."
"0.22"," Mike Pence","Well, first, we need to -- we need to make a commitment to rebuild our military, including modernizing our nuclear forces."
"0.22"," Tim Kaine","We have different views on -- on refugee issues and on immigration."
"0.22"," Tim Kaine","... but on fundamental issues of morality, we should let women make their own decisions."
"0.22"," Mike Pence","And with regard to when I struggle, I appreciate, and -- and -- and -- I have a great deal of respect for Senator Kaine's sincere faith."
"0.22"," Mike Pence","There's a question that you asked a little bit earlier that I want to go back to."
"0.22"," Mike Pence","It was heartbreaking."
"0.22"," Tim Kaine","He wouldn't -- he wouldn't support -- this is important, Elaine."
"0.22"," Tim Kaine","Donald Trump, again and again, has praised Vladimir Putin."
"0.22"," Tim Kaine","... and said it was discriminatory..."
"0.22"," Mike Pence","Yeah, and so -- but first, you know, let's make sure we're putting the safety and security of the American people first instead of Hillary Clinton expanding the Syrian refugee program..."
"0.21"," Mike Pence","So you bet I suspended that program."
"0.21"," Tim Kaine","Vladimir Putin."
"0.21"," Mike Pence","I did not make that statement."
"0.21"," Tim Kaine","And in the Senate, I have good working relationships across the aisle."
"0.21"," Tim Kaine","Hillary Clinton said something on the campaign trail, and the very next day, she said, you know what, I shouldn't have said that."
"0.21"," Tim Kaine","And I just -- again, I cannot believe that Governor Pence will defend the insult-driven campaign that Donald Trump has run."
"0.21"," Mike Pence","That will all change the day Donald Trump becomes president of the United States."
"0.21"," Mike Pence","But there's a -- there's a reason why people question the trustworthiness of Hillary Clinton."
"0.21"," Tim Kaine","So let's start with not praising Vladimir Putin as a great leader."
"0.21"," Tim Kaine","It's very important."
"0.21"," Tim Kaine","And there's two key elements to it."
"0.21"," Tim Kaine","Hillary Clinton knows exactly who this guy is."
"0.21"," Tim Kaine","Hillary told me why she asked me to be her running mate."
"0.21"," Tim Kaine","You're not going to cut taxes."
"0.21"," Mike Pence","And I stand by that decision."
"0.21"," Mike Pence","... the U.N. wants us to expand the Syrian refugee program..."
"0.21"," Mike Pence","I just did."
"0.21"," Tim Kaine","And both Donald Trump and Mike Pence want to get rid of birthright citizenship."
"0.21"," Tim Kaine","That model still works across our country, but there are some other models that don't work, an overly aggressive, more militarized model."
"0.21"," Mike Pence","... bring the -- let's welcome the children into our world."
"0.21"," Mike Pence","We all know the routine."
"0.21"," Mike Pence","That's absolutely false."
"0.21"," Tim Kaine","It's two things."
"0.21"," Tim Kaine","So the foundation does good work."
"0.21"," Tim Kaine","This is pretty important."
"0.21"," Tim Kaine","My mom and dad are sitting right here."
"0.21"," Tim Kaine","But my primary role is to be Hillary Clinton's right-hand person and strong supporter as she puts together the most historic administration possible."
"0.21"," Tim Kaine","I'm not going to change my religious practice to get one vote, but I know how to take an oath and uphold the law."
"0.21"," Tim Kaine","Finish your sentence."
"0.21"," Tim Kaine","I apologize."
"0.21"," Tim Kaine","I apologize."
"0.21"," Tim Kaine","But, fourth, we also have to work with allies to share and surge intelligence."
"0.21"," Mike Pence","Senator, we have a deportation force."
"0.21"," Mike Pence","And, look, if you put aside -- push aside your alliances, who you're going to share intelligence with?"
"0.21"," Tim Kaine","She worked to deal with the Russians to reduce their chemical weapons stockpile."
"0.21"," Mike Pence","I grew up with a cornfield in my backyard."
"0.20"," Tim Kaine","\""They will all be gone.\"""
"0.20"," Mike Pence","Well, first, let me say, I appreciated the \""you're hired,\"" \""you're fired\"" thing, Senator."
"0.20"," Tim Kaine","They're starting to get worried about North Korea, too."
"0.20"," Mike Pence","It has to remain the policy of the United States of America the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, plain and simple."
"0.20"," Mike Pence","And he will."
"0.20"," Tim Kaine","A president has to do that."
"0.20"," Mike Pence","Did you work on that one a long time?"
"0.20"," Mike Pence","Our primary threat today is ISIS."
"0.20"," Mike Pence","I'm just trying to keep up with the insult-driven campaign on the other side of the table."
"0.20"," Tim Kaine","That was a real struggle."
"0.20"," Mike Pence","But my Christian faith became real for me when I made a personal decision for Christ when I was a freshman in college."
"0.20"," Mike Pence","That's not -- that's absolutely false."
"0.20"," Mike Pence","That is absolutely inaccurate."
"0.20"," Mike Pence","But about Aleppo and about Syria, I truly do believe that what America ought to do right now is immediately establish safe zones, so that families and vulnerable families with children can move out of those areas, work with our Arab partners, real time, right now, to make that happen."
"0.20"," Tim Kaine","That's the Hillary Clinton plan; she's got the experience to do it."
"0.20"," Tim Kaine","Anybody who thinks otherwise doesn't know Russian history and they don't know Vladimir Putin."
"0.20"," Mike Pence","Well, I think it's -- I think it's a great question, Elaine, but it really does begin with us reforming our immigration system and putting the interests, particularly the safety and security of the American people, first."
"0.20"," Mike Pence","I'm very, very happy to defend Donald Trump."
"0.20"," Mike Pence","It's absolutely inarguable."
"0.20"," Tim Kaine","Elaine, let me tell you why I trust Hillary Clinton."
"0.20"," Mike Pence","I forgive you."
"0.20"," Tim Kaine","John McCain said, I look in his eyes and I see KGB."
"0.20"," Tim Kaine","Those years included the years of 9/11."
"0.20"," Mike Pence","I'm happy to defend him."
"0.20"," Tim Kaine","Try to defend that."
"0.20"," Tim Kaine","You've got to pick your choice."
"0.20"," Tim Kaine","Hillary and I believe in comprehensive immigration reform."
"0.20"," Mike Pence","Look, what you just heard is they have a plan for open borders, amnesty."
"0.20"," Mike Pence","... and we'd have a much better picture of what the Clinton Foundation was about."
"0.20"," Tim Kaine","But I just want to make it very, very clear that he's trying to fuzz up what Donald Trump has said."
"0.20"," Tim Kaine","You're not."
"0.20"," Mike Pence","... they'd be court martialed."
"0.20"," Mike Pence","That's what this campaign is really about, Senator."
"0.20"," Mike Pence","But I have to tell you, I just -- I was listening to the avalanche of insults coming out of Senator Kaine a minute ago."
"0.20"," Mike Pence","They built a family and -- and a good name and a business."
"0.20"," Mike Pence","... and assurance to our allies."
"0.20"," Tim Kaine","My dad, who ran an iron working and welding shop, is here tonight."
"0.19"," Mike Pence","And that's what an intelligence surge means."
"0.19"," Tim Kaine","It's an easy one."
"0.19"," Mike Pence","He hasn't broken his promise."
"0.19"," Tim Kaine","Yeah, that's right, so now we're even."
"0.19"," Mike Pence","Don't put words in my mouth that I'm not defending him."
"0.19"," Mike Pence","And that's because they're paying attention."
"0.19"," Mike Pence","I understand the..."
"0.19"," Tim Kaine","Political contributions?"
"0.19"," Tim Kaine","I'm a gun-owner."
"0.19"," Tim Kaine","Well, we do."
"0.19"," Tim Kaine","I grew up in a wonderful household with great Irish Catholic parents."
"0.19"," Mike Pence","... so that families that can't have children can adopt more readily those children from crisis pregnancies."
"0.19"," Tim Kaine","You know, I'm just saying facts about your running mate."
"0.19"," Mike Pence","Thanks."
"0.19"," Tim Kaine","On the other hand, in Donald Trump, you have somebody who praises Vladimir Putin all the time."
"0.19"," Mike Pence","Honestly, Senator."
"0.19"," Mike Pence","Honestly, Senator."
"0.19"," Mike Pence","Yeah."
"0.19"," Mike Pence","Yeah."
"0.19"," Mike Pence","Yeah."
"0.19"," Mike Pence","Yeah."
"0.19"," Tim Kaine","And have they held onto that passion throughout their life, regardless of whether they were in office or not, succeeding or failing?"
"0.19"," Tim Kaine","It's your two minutes."
"0.19"," Mike Pence","Well, this is probably the difference between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton and Senator Kaine."
"0.19"," Tim Kaine","You have to."
"0.19"," Tim Kaine","And Donald Trump -- why would he do this?"
"0.19"," Tim Kaine","... persecuting journalists..."
"0.19"," Tim Kaine","She has a track record of working across the aisle to make things happen."
"0.19"," Tim Kaine","Yes, we can, and when we don't let them know, we don't let them in."
"0.19"," Mike Pence","You keep leaving that out of your quote."
"0.19"," Tim Kaine","I look forward to working together in whatever capacities we serve in."
"0.19"," Tim Kaine","All right."
"0.19"," Tim Kaine","But he does have dangerous ideas."
"0.19"," Mike Pence","Right."
"0.19"," Mike Pence","Right."
"0.19"," Mike Pence","Right."
"0.19"," Mike Pence","Right."
"0.19"," Tim Kaine","And Hillary kind of has that same feeling."
"0.19"," Tim Kaine","But I think it is really, really important that those of us who have deep faith lives don't feel that we could just substitute our own views for everybody else in society, regardless of their views."
"0.19"," Mike Pence","The answer to this economy is not more taxes."
"0.19"," Mike Pence","But what's it got to do with Russia?"
"0.18"," Tim Kaine","And you know that, Governor."
"0.18"," Mike Pence","Well, look, it's -- look, he's not a polished politician like you and Hillary Clinton."
"0.18"," Mike Pence","... is deeply troubling to me."
"0.18"," Tim Kaine","And he's breaking his promise."
"0.18"," Tim Kaine","Do you think Donald Trump is smart to not pay taxes?"
"0.18"," Mike Pence","But here's -- there is a choice, and it is a choice on life."
"0.18"," Tim Kaine","OK, now I can weigh in."
"0.18"," Mike Pence","You wouldn't necessarily know that."
"0.18"," Tim Kaine","And if you elect me, I will uphold the law."
"0.18"," Mike Pence","It's a principle that -- Senator Kaine -- and I'm very gentle about this, because I really do respect you -- it's a principle that you embrace."
"0.18"," Tim Kaine","She was on other committees."
"0.18"," Mike Pence","Border security, removing criminal aliens, upholding with law, and then -- but then, Senator, I'll work you when you go back to the Senate, I promise you, we'll work you to reform the immigration system."
"0.18"," Mike Pence","He basically was saying it's not going to happen again."
"0.18"," Tim Kaine","I've heard Senator Scott make that eloquent plea."
"0.18"," Tim Kaine","She's not going around praising Vladimir Putin as a great guy."
"0.18"," Tim Kaine","We have to keep it solvent."
"0.18"," Mike Pence","People in Fort Wayne, Indiana, know different."
"0.18"," Tim Kaine","She's had the experience doing it."
"0.18"," Mike Pence","... is astonishing to the American people."
"0.18"," Mike Pence","We can -- like Mother Teresa said at that famous national prayer breakfast..."
"0.18"," Tim Kaine","I can't believe that you won't defend your own voting record."
"0.18"," Tim Kaine","Gadi Eizenkot, you can go check it."
"0.18"," Tim Kaine","But, Governor Pence..."
"0.18"," Tim Kaine","I am interested to hear whether he'll defend his running mate's not releasing taxes and not paying taxes."
"0.18"," Tim Kaine","But it is not the role of the public servant to mandate that for everybody else."
"0.18"," Tim Kaine","If you mistake leadership for dictatorship, and you can't tell the difference, a country that's running its economy into the ground..."
"0.18"," Tim Kaine","Well, if you want to put more American troops in Iraq, you can propose that."
"0.18"," Tim Kaine","Absolutely."
"0.18"," Tim Kaine","These are very, very good things."
"0.18"," Mike Pence","You know, things don't always come out exactly the way he means them."
"0.18"," Mike Pence","We -- we grieve with those who grieve."
"0.18"," Mike Pence","Strength."
"0.17"," Mike Pence","And then she labeled one after another \""ism\"" on millions of Americans who believe that we can have a stronger America at home and abroad, who believe we can get this economy moving again, who believe that we can end illegal immigration once and for all."
"0.17"," Tim Kaine","That is absolutely false and you know that."
"0.17"," Tim Kaine","That would be a big mistake because it polarizes the relationship between the police and the community."
"0.17"," Tim Kaine","But, Governor..."
"0.17"," Mike Pence","We all lived through that day as a nation."
"0.17"," Mike Pence","Senator, that's -- that's nonsense."
"0.17"," Mike Pence","I'm happy to defend him, Senator."
"0.17"," Tim Kaine","When we don't know who they are, we don't let them in."
"0.17"," Mike Pence","We've just got to have American strength on the world stage."
"0.17"," Mike Pence","And I cannot -- I can't conscience about -- about a party that supports that."
"0.17"," Mike Pence","That's..."
"0.17"," Tim Kaine","And with respect to refugees, we want to keep people out if they're dangerous."
"0.17"," Tim Kaine","For me, the hardest struggle in my faith life was the Catholic Church is against the death penalty and so am I."
"0.17"," Mike Pence","Plain and simple."
"0.17"," Tim Kaine","And this is one of these ones where you can just go to the tape on it and see what Donald Trump has said."
"0.17"," Mike Pence","I mean, to hold to the view -- and I know Senator Kaine, you hold pro-life views personally -- but the very idea that a child that is almost born into the world could still have their life taken from them is just anathema to me."
"0.17"," Tim Kaine","Can you defend it?"
"0.17"," Tim Kaine","She was on the Armed Services Committee."
"0.17"," Mike Pence","I know you were."
"0.17"," Tim Kaine","Now..."
"0.17"," Mike Pence","And I get all of that."
"0.17"," Tim Kaine","I just have to correct Governor Pence...."
"0.17"," Mike Pence","Well, I would suggest to you that the families that live in our inner cities that are besieged by crime..."
"0.17"," Tim Kaine","Mike Pence..."
"0.17"," Mike Pence","Don't put words in my mouth."
"0.17"," Tim Kaine","No, he won't."
"0.17"," Mike Pence","I also want to thank Donald Trump for making that call and inviting us to be a part of this ticket."
"0.17"," Mike Pence","The Seventh Circuit..."
"0.17"," Mike Pence","I mean, I -- we -- we mourn with those who mourn."
"0.17"," Tim Kaine","So, on the foundation."
"0.17"," Mike Pence","Yeah, here we go."
"0.17"," Tim Kaine","And if -- if you're afraid to have the discussion, you'll never solve it."
"0.17"," Mike Pence","You've got to err on the side of the safety and security of the American people, Senator."
"0.17"," Tim Kaine","Now, I get to weigh in."
"0.17"," Tim Kaine","There are areas where we can cooperate."
"0.17"," Tim Kaine","Elaine..."
"0.17"," Tim Kaine","I try to practice my religion in a very devout way and follow the teachings of my church in my own personal life."
"0.17"," Mike Pence","And those judges -- those judges said..."
"0.17"," Mike Pence","There's a broad range of other things that we ought to do, as well."
"0.17"," Mike Pence","We're going to -- we're going to go back to the days of peace through strength."
"0.17"," Mike Pence","They're going to raise your taxes."
"0.17"," Tim Kaine","Yeah, that's an easy one for me, Elaine."
"0.17"," Mike Pence","Donald Trump is a strong leader..."
"0.17"," Tim Kaine","Here's what I learned as a mayor and a governor."
"0.17"," Mike Pence","But that's not what you're talking about."
"0.17"," Mike Pence","I must have hit a nerve here."
"0.17"," Mike Pence","... where people can come into this country."
"0.17"," Mike Pence","OK..."
"0.17"," Mike Pence","... who is going to lead with American strength."
"0.17"," Mike Pence","Did you all just hear that?"
"0.16"," Tim Kaine","That's seared onto her, the need to beat terrorism."
"0.16"," Mike Pence","He's going..."
"0.16"," Mike Pence","..."
"0.16"," Mike Pence","... that was discovered..."
"0.16"," Mike Pence","I'll be -- I'll be very respectful."
"0.16"," Mike Pence","Oh..."
"0.16"," Tim Kaine","Yeah, let's talk about the state of..."
"0.16"," Tim Kaine","And I know he's laughing at this, but every president..."
"0.16"," Mike Pence","But in the midst -- Elaine, thank you."
"0.16"," Mike Pence","Because there is -- a society can be judged by how it deals with its most vulnerable, the aged, the infirm, the disabled, and the unborn."
"0.16"," Mike Pence","We could improve adoption..."
"0.16"," Tim Kaine","And I can't imagine how Governor Pence can defend the insult- driven selfish \""me first\"" style of Donald Trump."
"0.16"," Tim Kaine","And that's what it's going to take."
"0.16"," Mike Pence","This is a very challenging time in the life of our nation."
"0.16"," Mike Pence","Can I speak about the cybersecurity surge at all?"
"0.16"," Mike Pence","When you talk about all these -- all these baseless rumors about Russia and the rest, Hillary Clinton -- you asked the trustworthy question at the very beginning -- the reason..."
"0.16"," Tim Kaine","I'm not sure he could stand up so tough to the people who have loaned him money."
"0.16"," Mike Pence","That..."
"0.16"," Tim Kaine","Sure."
"0.16"," Mike Pence","I mean, it really is astonishing that on the day..."
"0.16"," Tim Kaine","But do you -- do you think -- do you think we should have -- more nuclear weapons in the world will make us safer?"
"0.16"," Tim Kaine","And both Donald Trump and Mike Pence think we ought to eliminate the federal minimum wage."
"0.16"," Mike Pence","They always say we're going to do this, we're going to do that, we'll eventually get the border..."
"0.16"," Mike Pence","How does that work?"
"0.16"," Mike Pence","People need to understand, we can come together as a nation."
"0.16"," Mike Pence","The larger question here..."
"0.16"," Tim Kaine","It is so great to be back at Longwood University in Farmville, Virginia."
"0.16"," Tim Kaine","And we will keep it solvent."
"0.15"," Mike Pence","You essentially..."
"0.15"," Mike Pence","You just heard Senator Kaine reject stop-and-frisk."
"0.15"," Mike Pence","The potential is there to really change the direction of this country, but it's going to take leadership to do it."
"0.15"," Mike Pence","Well, let me -- let me say first and foremost that, Senator, you and Hillary Clinton would know a lot about an insult- driven campaign."
"0.15"," Tim Kaine","This is a very special place."
"0.15"," Mike Pence","And I look forward if I'm privileged to be in this role of working with you in the Senate to make sure that we resource that effort."
"0.15"," Mike Pence","Well, thanks, Elaine."
"0.15"," Mike Pence","I..."
"0.15"," Tim Kaine","I..."
"0.15"," Tim Kaine","You've got to be tough on Russia."
"0.15"," Mike Pence","Right and..."
"0.15"," Mike Pence","Senator Kaine?"
"0.15"," Tim Kaine","A U.S. senator."
"0.15"," Mike Pence","I'm telling you..."
"0.15"," Mike Pence","Well, thanks."
"0.15"," Tim Kaine","And I served in the Senate."
"0.15"," Tim Kaine","I was in Virginia where the Pentagon's..."
"0.15"," Tim Kaine","And that's what I bring to the ticket, that experience having served at all levels of government."
"0.15"," Tim Kaine","Until he..."
"0.15"," Mike Pence","Well, it's a wonderful question."
"0.15"," Tim Kaine","But we really feel like you should live fully and with enthusiasm the commands of your faith."
"0.15"," Tim Kaine","Here's what people should look at as they look at a public servant."
"0.15"," Tim Kaine","Let's talk about them."
"0.15"," Mike Pence","And we don't have the resources or the will to deport them systemically."
"0.15"," Mike Pence","We can create a culture of life."
"0.15"," Tim Kaine","Now exactly what action, you would have to determine what your intelligence was, how certain you were of that intelligence, but you would have to take action."
"0.15"," Tim Kaine","Hillary and I want to do enforcement based on, are people dangerous?"
"0.15"," Mike Pence","And that really has got to stop."
"0.15"," Tim Kaine","So we're working together with China, and we need to."
"0.15"," Mike Pence","They have not -- Elaine, let me finish a sentence."
"0.15"," Tim Kaine","And she's got a plan to do it."
"0.15"," Tim Kaine","Elaine, if I could -- if I could jump in."
"0.15"," Mike Pence","But what I can't understand is with Hillary Clinton and now Senator Kaine at her side is to support a practice like partial-birth abortion."
"0.15"," Tim Kaine","Here's her plan to defeat ISIL."
"0.14"," Mike Pence","And my Christian faith is at the very heart of who I am."
"0.14"," Mike Pence","... that she refused to turn over in her private server..."
"0.14"," Tim Kaine","... or John McCain is not a hero, he is showing you who he is."
"0.14"," Mike Pence","Senator."
"0.14"," Tim Kaine","And to add to it, and to add to it, and to add to it, we are a nation of immigrants."
"0.14"," Tim Kaine","And I guess all of us who do pay for those things, I guess we're stupid."
"0.14"," Mike Pence","The American people can review that."
"0.14"," Mike Pence","Right, this is grade school."
"0.14"," Mike Pence","Thank you."
"0.14"," Mike Pence","Thank you."
"0.14"," Mike Pence","We're going to -- we're going to -- we're going to..."
"0.14"," Mike Pence","Elaine, I have to respond to this."
"0.14"," Tim Kaine","And if -- and I'll just say this, Governor."
"0.14"," Tim Kaine","If you don't know the difference between dictatorship and leadership, then you got to go back to a fifth-grade civics class."
"0.14"," Tim Kaine","And guess what?"
"0.14"," Mike Pence","He -- look..."
"0.14"," Mike Pence","Senator, you've whipped out that Mexican thing again."
"0.14"," Tim Kaine","Of course we can."
"0.14"," Tim Kaine","That's what we ought to be doing in public life."
"0.14"," Mike Pence","She had a private server..."
"0.14"," Mike Pence","I try and spend a little time on my knees every day."
"0.14"," Tim Kaine","I'm going to talk about the foundation, and then I'll talk about North Korea."
"0.14"," Tim Kaine","No, I..."
"0.14"," Tim Kaine","And I know you can't defend."
"0.14"," Tim Kaine","That is completely antithetical to the Jeffersonian values of..."
"0.14"," Mike Pence","And secondly, I just have to tell you that the provocations by Russia need to be met with American strength."
"0.14"," Tim Kaine","And to add..."
"0.14"," Mike Pence","They're going to see that real change can happen after decades of just talking about it."
"0.14"," Mike Pence","But the problem with that..."
"0.14"," Tim Kaine","You don't get to decide the rights and wrongs of this."
"0.14"," Tim Kaine","He doesn't want to acknowledge..."
"0.14"," Tim Kaine","He doesn't want to acknowledge..."
"0.14"," Mike Pence","Because there are..."
"0.14"," Mike Pence","I believe it with all my heart."
"0.13"," Tim Kaine","They didn't want her to say that, but she did."
"0.13"," Mike Pence","But let me tell you what will really make the Middle East dangerous."
"0.13"," Tim Kaine","So there is a fundamental respect issue here."
"0.13"," Mike Pence","There they go again."
"0.13"," Mike Pence","I think if you're going to be pro-life, you should -- you should be pro- adoption."
"0.13"," Tim Kaine","Here's four."
"0.13"," Mike Pence","We need to -- we need to marshal the resources of our allies in the region, and in the immediate, we need to act and act now to get people out of harm's way."
"0.13"," Mike Pence","Absolutely I will."
"0.13"," Tim Kaine","I have to..."
"0.13"," Tim Kaine","But, Governor Pence, I just..."
"0.13"," Tim Kaine","Elaine, thank you for being here tonight, and, Governor Pence, welcome."
"0.13"," Tim Kaine","Living our lives of faith or motivation with enthusiasm and excitement, convincing other, dialoguing with each other about important moral issues of the day..."
"0.13"," Mike Pence","You -- honestly, Senator, you can roll out the numbers and the sunny side, but I got to tell you, people in Scranton know different."
"0.13"," Mike Pence","Well, that offended me."
"0.13"," Mike Pence","But, look, this is very tough stuff."
"0.13"," Tim Kaine","Because I think it's fine to be a Democrat or Republican or independent, but after Election Day, the goal is work together."
"0.13"," Tim Kaine","Governor Pence -- Governor Pence doesn't think the world's going so well and he, you know, is going to say it's everybody's fault."
"0.13"," Mike Pence","Better skill and capacity, but also better alliances."
"0.13"," Mike Pence","... tonight."
"0.13"," Tim Kaine","But they told you there's a right way and a wrong way to do it."
"0.13"," Mike Pence","But I'm telling you what the policy of our administration would be."
"0.13"," Tim Kaine","So let's talk about abortion and choice."
"0.13"," Mike Pence","I have to go back to."
"0.13"," Mike Pence","But it all for me begins with cherishing the dignity, the worth, the value of every human life."
"0.13"," Mike Pence","Absolutely..."
"0.13"," Tim Kaine","The last thing -- the last thing I want to ask Governor Pence is..."
"0.13"," Tim Kaine","Well, this is one where we can just kind of go to the tape on it."
"0.13"," Tim Kaine","... and talk about -- let me talk about the things that Governor Pence doesn't want to acknowledge, Elaine."
"0.13"," Mike Pence","Well, we're answering the question about -- about a business thing, is he..."
"0.13"," Tim Kaine","How can you support the troops if you won't pay taxes?"
"0.13"," Mike Pence","Well, let's -- no, no, don't put words in my mouth."
"0.12"," Tim Kaine","And the last thing I'll say is this..."
"0.12"," Tim Kaine","I think you will help me figure out how to govern this nation so that we always keep in mind that the success of the administration is the difference we make in people's lives."
"0.12"," Tim Kaine","Well, I would admit that's not a polished..."
"0.12"," Tim Kaine","And so I had to grapple with that."
"0.12"," Tim Kaine","You will look in vain to see Donald Trump ever taking responsibility for anybody and apologizing."
"0.12"," Tim Kaine","We would agree this was a heartbreaking example."
"0.12"," Tim Kaine","So here's what we'll do."
"0.12"," Tim Kaine","So here's what we'll do."
"0.12"," Tim Kaine","We can encourage people to support life."
"0.12"," Mike Pence","It's my time, Senator."
"0.12"," Tim Kaine","Elaine, this is a fundamental question, a fundamental question."
"0.12"," Mike Pence","It's deeply humbling for me to be here, to be surrounded by my -- my wonderful family."
"0.12"," Mike Pence","And so I want to thank all of you for being -- being with us tonight."
"0.12"," Tim Kaine","We trust Hillary Clinton, my wife and I, and we trust her with the most important thing in our life."
"0.12"," Tim Kaine","I don't like saying that in front of my wife and my mother."
"0.12"," Mike Pence","They want to see an American comeback."
"0.12"," Mike Pence","I mean, I will give you -- and I was in Washington, D.C., on 9/11."
"0.12"," Mike Pence","And let me -- let me -- this whole Putin thing."
"0.12"," Tim Kaine","Let me tell you this."
"0.12"," Tim Kaine","Can we just be clear -- Hillary and I will do immigration enforcement and we'll vet refugees based on whether they're dangerous or not."
"0.12"," Mike Pence","Well, first off, thank you, Elaine, and thank you to -- thank you to Norwood University for their wonderful hospitality and the Commission on Presidential Debates."
"0.12"," Mike Pence","But I have to tell you that -- that all this talk about tax returns -- and I get it, you know, you want to keep bringing that up."
"0.12"," Mike Pence","You just said better."
"0.12"," Tim Kaine","Well, I guess I can't believe you are defending the position that there is no bias and it's a topic we don't even..."
"0.12"," Mike Pence","So -- the FBI..."
"0.12"," Mike Pence","Thank you, Senator."
"0.12"," Mike Pence","That's how Washington always plays it."
"0.12"," Tim Kaine","So how do deal with him?"
"0.11"," Tim Kaine","The only way the American public will see whether he has a conflict of interest..."
"0.11"," Tim Kaine","This is important --"
"0.11"," Tim Kaine","And I want to make this very plain."
"0.11"," Tim Kaine","And if you're afraid to have..."
"0.11"," Tim Kaine","Elaine, I think that's a very fair comment."
"0.11"," Mike Pence","And let me be very clear on this Russian thing."
"0.11"," Tim Kaine","That's why I'm so proud to be her running mate."
"0.11"," Mike Pence","But let me go back to this Iran thing."
"0.11"," Mike Pence","So, Senator, this -- this insult-driven campaign, I mean..."
"0.11"," Tim Kaine","If you can't meet Nixon's standard..."
"0.11"," Mike Pence","Senator, the..."
"0.11"," Mike Pence","When you hear him say he wants to make America great again, when we do that, I truly do believe the American people are going to be standing taller."
"0.11"," Tim Kaine","I'll run through the list of things where you won't defend..."
"0.11"," Mike Pence","I understand why you want to change the subject."
"0.11"," Tim Kaine","... if you can't tell the difference, you shouldn't be commander-in-chief."
"0.11"," Mike Pence","It must have -- must have..."
"0.11"," Tim Kaine","I'd love to hear Governor Pence tell me what's so enjoyable or comical about nuclear war."
"0.11"," Mike Pence","Well, Thank you."
"0.11"," Tim Kaine","Well, I think -- isn't this a discussion?"
"0.11"," Tim Kaine","And so here's -- here's an example, heartbreaking."
"0.11"," Mike Pence","The American people want to see our nation standing tall on the world stage again."
"0.11"," Tim Kaine","But she knows how to sit down at a table and negotiate tough deals."
"0.11"," Tim Kaine","I am glad to talk about the foundation."
"0.11"," Tim Kaine","And that's how you find out who may be trying to recruit, who may be trying to come to one country or the next."
"0.11"," Mike Pence","To answer your question, we just need American strength."
"0.11"," Tim Kaine","I think you should live your moral values."
"0.11"," Tim Kaine","Elaine, let me just mention one thing."
"0.11"," Mike Pence","So to answer your question, I would say I -- I would hope that if -- if the responsibility ever fell to me in this role, that I would meet it with the way that I'm going to meet the responsibility should I be elected vice president of the United States."
"0.10"," Mike Pence","No, I'm -- look..."
"0.10"," Tim Kaine","It'll be whether we can make somebody's life better, whether we can make a classroom better learning environment for schoolkids or teachers, whether we can make a safer -- it's going to be about results."
"0.10"," Mike Pence","That's an indictment of the weak and feckless leadership..."
"0.10"," Mike Pence","And I couldn't be more proud to be standing with a pro-life candidate in Donald Trump."
"0.10"," Mike Pence","I think the best way that we can bring people together is through change in Washington, D.C."
"0.10"," Tim Kaine","I'll tell you what offends me..."
"0.10"," Tim Kaine","Here's what Hillary and I will not do."
"0.10"," Tim Kaine","I think that's not such a hard choice."
"0.10"," Mike Pence","So for me, my faith informs my life."
"0.10"," Mike Pence","And I get, this is -- this is the old scare tactic that they roll out..."
"0.10"," Tim Kaine","And this is something I got a lot of scar tissue and experience on."
"0.10"," Mike Pence","Well, thank you, Elaine, and thanks for a great discussion..."
"0.10"," Tim Kaine","And I just want to talk about the tone that's set from the top."
"0.10"," Mike Pence","Thank you, Senator, I'll..."
"0.10"," Tim Kaine","So if you're born here, but your parents don't have documents, they want to eliminate that."
"0.10"," Tim Kaine","It is so painful to suggest that we go back to think about these days where an African-American could not be a citizen of the United States."
"0.10"," Mike Pence","I have to tell you, I'm a -- I'm a small-town boy from a place not too different from Farmville."
"0.09"," Mike Pence","But I would -- I would suggest to you, what we need to do is assert a stronger leadership at the national level to support law enforcement."
"0.09"," Tim Kaine","Well, I'm going to see if you can defend any of it."
"0.09"," Mike Pence","And, Senator Kaine, it's an honor to be here with you, as well."
"0.09"," Mike Pence","And I just -- I also want to say -- I want to say thanks to everyone that's looking in tonight, who understands what an enormously important time this is in the life of our nation."
"0.09"," Mike Pence","This isn't the old days where you can just say stuff and people believe it."
"0.09"," Mike Pence","We can get America moving again."
"0.09"," Tim Kaine","Can I -- can I explain..."
"0.09"," Mike Pence","Now, you all need to know out there, this is basic stuff."
"0.09"," Tim Kaine","And I just think that should be underlined."
"0.09"," Mike Pence","Senator, I think I'm still on my time."
"0.09"," Mike Pence","And if you want me to go there, I'll go there."
"0.09"," Tim Kaine","And I cannot believe..."
"0.09"," Mike Pence","I understand why you want to change -- I understand why you want to change the subject."
"0.09"," Mike Pence","Well..."
"0.09"," Tim Kaine","So get this."
"0.09"," Mike Pence","This is the grade school thing again?"
"0.09"," Mike Pence","And if you think that's all working, then you look at the other side of the table."
"0.09"," Mike Pence","Well, Senator, I must have hit a..."
"0.08"," Mike Pence","I just, look..."
"0.08"," Mike Pence","But, look, if you're going to be critical of me on that, that's fair game."
"0.08"," Mike Pence","I just think what we ought to do is we ought to stop seizing on these moments of tragedy."
"0.08"," Mike Pence","How do you know that?"
"0.08"," Tim Kaine","How do you know that?"
"0.08"," Tim Kaine","I do want to come back to that, but..."
"0.08"," Tim Kaine","I'm so proud of her."
"0.08"," Mike Pence","I couldn't be more proud to be standing with Donald Trump, who's standing for the right to life."
"0.08"," Mike Pence","Well, let me interrupt -- let me interrupt you and finish my sentence, if I can."
"0.08"," Mike Pence","And so..."
"0.08"," Tim Kaine","Now, let me just say this..."
"0.07"," Tim Kaine","Elaine, let me -- let me..."
"0.07"," Tim Kaine","Elaine, can I..."
"0.07"," Tim Kaine","Well, can I say..."
"0.07"," Tim Kaine","Elaine, I want to..."
"0.06"," Tim Kaine","Well, let me -- let me come back..."
"0.06"," Tim Kaine","But I just want to say, those who say that we should not..."
"0.06"," Tim Kaine","But I'd like to correct..."
"0.06"," Tim Kaine","Elaine, let me talk about something."
"0.05"," Tim Kaine","Let me talk about this..."
"0.04"," Tim Kaine","And -- and -- and I just think a guy who praises..."
"0.04"," Mike Pence","I just think..."
"0.04"," Tim Kaine","How can that..."
